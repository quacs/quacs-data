    "biography": "Abby Kinchy is a sociologist, working in the interdisciplinary field of science and technology studies (STS). Her research examines the relationship between science and democracy, with two main objectives: 1) to illuminate how science shapes politics and policy making, and 2) to understand changing forms of public participation in the making of science and technology. Kinchy's research and teaching focus on topics relating to agriculture, ecological sustainability, and environmental justice. Most recently, Kinchy's research has focused on the politics of \"citizen science\"--public participation in scientific research. Her book on this topic, co-authored with Aya H. Kimura, is Science by the People: Participation, Power, and the Politics of Environmental Knowledge (Rutgers, 2019). In addition, her current NSF-funded project, Nuestros Suelos/Our Soil, explores how citizen science could help urban communities to identify heavy metal contamination in soil and to advocate for solutions. She previously led the NSF-funded Watershed Knowledge Mapping Project, which examined the practices and politics of environmental monitoring in the context of shale gas development, or \"fracking.\" Kinchy's work extends beyond the politics of citizen science. She is the author of Seeds, Science, and Struggle: The Global Politics of Transgenic Crops (MIT, 2012). She is also a co-organizer of STS Underground, a research network that advances social science research on the technoscientific dimensions of mining, burial, and other forms of subterranean exploration.",

    "area": "stress well-being emotion neuroplasticity",
    "biography": "RESEARCH Alicia Walf's research interests are fueled by the broad question: Why are there individual differences in stress? This question led her to studying hormones' actions for growth and plasticity in the brain and body. She has since refined my pursuit to include consideration of body, brain, and mind relationships as they relate to memory, perception, social cognition and emotions. A current focus is to understand the contextual variables important for these effects of hormones for these behavioral and cognitive processes. Dr. Walf has taken a cross-species and cross-discipline approach. Similarities across species for stress and hormone effects are important to note as they suggest common mechanisms across mammals, likely including humans as well, in the brain and body responses to challenges. Estradiol has novel actions for brain and body growth: Dr. Walf has investigated the effects, brain regions, and receptor targets of estradiol across endogenous cycles over the adult rodent lifespan as well as effects of different dosing of estradiol or other estrogenic drugs for affective behavior (e.g. stress, anxiety, fear) in the hippocampus and amygdala (regions of the limbic system). These studies in animal models corroborated what was being found in the clinical literature; that is, variability in the effects of estradiol were due to many contextual variables, including, the individuals' age, previous hormonal and behavioral experiences, stress responsiveness, and health. Despite these promising findings, the growth effects of estradiol required further consideration. A major consideration in studying steroid hormones, like estradiol, is that they cannot be contained; that is, they move through the circulatory system and cellular membranes in the brain as well as the rest of the body with relative ease. The specificity of steroids' effects lies in where receptors are and how steroids can act on them. Because a basic function of steroids is to induce growth, there is potential for increasing growth in estradiol-sensitive body tissues, associated with reproductive cancers. Studies supported by a grant from the Department of Defense Breast Cancer Research Program demonstrated that estradiol's functional effects in the hippocampus, but not proliferation in the body, involve ERbeta, a newly-discovered type of estrogen receptor. These studies also demonstrated that the mechanisms of estradiol for affect/emotions and memory in the hippocampus are not as distinct as previously argued and may involve novel hormone targets. Dr. Walf's research productivity and use of novel approaches in the field was recognized by her receiving a competitive and prestigious award, the inaugural Luciano Martini Prize for Young Investigators in Neuroendocrinology, named in honor of a trailblazer in the study of neurosteroids. Hormones' rapid effects to alter behavior and behaviors' rapid effects to alter hormones: Dr. Walf's work in hormone mechanisms relating to cognitive and emotional aspects of stress focus on the rapid effects of hormones through novel receptor and intracellular signaling targets in brain regions, such as the reward pathway and limbic system. These studies contribute to the field by showing that the effects of hormones for behavior are bidirectional, with hormones altering many behaviors (e.g. reproduction, learning, social interactions, stress) as well as these behaviors themselves changing hormones, such as neurosteroids (steroid hormones made in the brain), and thereby brain plasticity. This is a key finding relating to how hormones may alter brain and behavioral plasticity, and has continued to drive her research. Individual differences in response to stress and hormones in the context of brain and body health: Dr. Walf's overarching current research aim is elucidating the mechanisms of hormones in the brain as integrators of the internal and external environment as it relates to stress and well-being. These studies are currently being conducted using different approaches in human subjects. Her drive for pursuing the research goals on understanding described above is not only fueled by curiosity, but to provide hands-on training and mentoring of students in research of these clinically-relevant questions relating to hormones in the brain and body. Students are welcome to contact Dr. Walf about getting involved in these studies. Short descriptions of current projects: 1) Studies on understanding well-being and mechanisms of contemplative practice within specific contexts are examples of current research investigating body and brain relationships as they are related to well-being and resiliency. For example, studies are ongoing about mindful/attentional practices for stress responding and higher cognitive processes, such as creativity. These are studies done to understand effects and mechanisms, but also to incorporate best practice in supporting growth, resiliency, and well-being in the classroom. 2) Another way to study hormones as integrators of the external and internal environment is to investigate these effects in collaboration with artists and architects. For example, Dr. Walf and collaborators investigate how artistic practice and performance and characteristics of built environments may alter cognitive performance and stress responses in human subjects. 3) To understand risk factors for age-related changes in emotional and cognitive function, in-person and web-based testing is being conducted. A novel risk factor being investigated is changes in sense of smell and whether olfactory training can be a potential prevention technique for Alzheimer's Disease and other neurodegenerative brain diseases. TEACHING Dr. Walf's focus on engaging in behaviors that encourage growth is not limited to research endpoints, but also her teaching approach and the behaviors that she engages in to support growth in the various communities she is part of and can support. Dr. Walf is committed to training, mentorship, and educational outreach. She is driven to support a diverse and inclusive environment in the classroom and beyond to promote well-being and resiliency to stress.

For example, interest rates and stock prices incorporate information about investor expectations of future real economic activity and inflation. Can we extract those expectations from the data and put them to use in policy analysis or investment strategy? Also, bank lending is a major driving force for real economic activity. How does this channel operate? What drives bank lending itself? How is it affected by financial regulation?\u201d In 1988-89, he developed (with Gikas Hardouvelis) a probit model of the probability of a future recession. Since then, the model has correctly forecasted the last three U.S. recessions in real time with a lead time of about one year and no false positives. Professor Estrella has also written extensively about financial regulation, proposing in 1995 an innovative system for bank capital regulation that has the potential to prevent systemic problems arising from the failure of large financial institutions. From 1991 to 2001, he represented the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in international negotiations on bank regulation under the auspices of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. In econometrics, Professor Estrella derived a pseudo R-squared for dichotomous dependent variable models that outperforms other alternatives, including the classic McFadden measure. The measure has become part of the standard output in many widely-used econometric packages. He has also provided exact critical and probability values for use in time-series breakpoint tests in connection with generalized method of moments estimates.

    "biography": "Atsushi Akera is a historian of technology and an associate professor in the Department of Science and Technology Studies. In his early career, Akera focused on the history of computing, using the development of computers as a window into the American system of Cold War research and development. His first book, Calculating a Natural World: Computers, Scientists and Engineers during the Rise of U.S. Cold War Research, uses the history of computing to describe broad-based changes in the institutional infrastructure for research in the United States. More recently, Akera has focused on engineering education and engineering education reform. Global changes in engineering require intensive scrutiny toward how we train engineers. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re educating the professional engineers for the next half century, and they will require a much broader range of skills than engineers have had in the past,\u201d said Akera. \u201cAre U.S. engineering schools ready for the kind of deep analysis needed to respond intelligently to the challenges ahead? It is important for our students to have a much stronger awareness the global context in which they\u2019ll be performing their work. They also need to understand much better the challenges of problem formulation: we so often introduce our students to the basic skills of problem solving, but less often educate them to envision the potential that technology has to transform our society and economy.\u201d Akera is currently collaborating with Bruce Seely, Dean of the College of Sciences and Arts at Michigan Technological University in publishing a book on the history of engineering education reform in the US from 1945 to the present. Akera currently serves as Graduate Program Director for the department and is Associate Editor for the journal Engineering Studies. He has served as the chair of the American Society of Engineering Education Liberal Education / Engineering & Society Division; a member of the Society for the History of Technology\u2019s (SHOT) Executive Council; and as Associate Editor in Chief of the IEEE Annals of the History of Computing. At Rensselaer, he has served as the Secretary of the Faculty; as Director of the First Year Studies Program; and was the Founding Director of the Vasudha Living & Learning Community.

    "biography": "Bacteria are the most abundant organisms on earth. They are found almost every possible biological niche, from ordinary soil to deep oceans and geological formations. They also interact with the human body; some bacteria are essential for life while others can be deadly. The ability of bacteria to flourish in such a wide range of environments is due in large part to the enzymes that populate their cell membranes. These enzymes make up the active interface between the cell and the environment. One of their roles is to ensure the interior of the cell is a hospitable place for the biochemistry of life in spite of changing and often hostile conditions outside. Among the most important of these membrane enzymes are the ones that transport ions into and out of the cell. These ion transporters are essential for maintaining favorable concentrations of ions inside the cell, but ion transport is also at the heart of energy production in the cell. Transport of H+ and Na+ create gradients that provide energy for processes as diverse as motility of the cell, import of nutrients and extrusion of chemicals that are toxic to the cell--the latter is responsible for a significant class of antibiotic resistance. The focus of my research is the physiology and biochemistry that allow bacteria to adapt and proliferate in diverse environments. In particular, we are interested in understanding the role of ion gradients involved in producing energy and maintaining stable, favorable internal conditions in spite of changing environments. We work on 3 interrelated projects: 1) Energy metabolism of the gut bacterium Bacteroides fragilis , where we are investigating a new paradigm in which this organism, previously classified as a strict anaerobe, actually depends on aerobic respiration for its survival and role in the community of intestinal microflora. 2) Adaptation to changing environments by the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa , focusing on enzymes that generate and consume the Na + and H + gradients and how these systems function and interoperate. 3) Functional and mechanistic studies of two redox-driven Na + pumping enzymes: NQR and RNF from Vibrio cholerae and other bacteria. The projects in my laboratory range from basic microbiology, characterizing the physiology of bacteria and their interactions with other cells, to biophysical chemistry, spectroscopy (visible, fluorescence, FTIR, and EPR) and rapid kinetics in order to understand the molecular mechanisms of ion transport and energy production enzymes. We study Vibrio cholerae , the cause of the disease cholera, Pseudomonas aeruginos a which are implicated in cystic fibrosis, as well as Bacteroides fra gilis, which are beneficial gut bacteria, and use infection models including mice, macrophages, and fruit flies. We are particularly interested in two enzymes: Na + -pumping NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (NQR), a respiratory enzyme found only in bacteria that uniquely pumps Na+ instead of H+, and Na + pumping Ferredoxin:NAD oxidoreductase (RNF). These enzymes, are found in many pathogens, marine bacteria, and colon bacteria and are important for adaptation and proliferation of these organisms in diverse environments. In the case of NQR, my group defined the redox cofactors of the enzyme, their redox reactions, the pathway of electron transfer through these cofactors, and which of these electron transfer steps are linked to energy conservation. We are currently trying to understand the pathway that carries Na+ across the membrane and the mechanism that couples the redox reactions to this uphill transport of Na+.",

Over the past 30-40 years, mean maximum temperatures have risen by 2.2 degrees C in the Luquillo forest and 2.4 degrees C in the Chamela forest. In theory, tropical insects should be especially sensitive to climate warming and these increases should have caused major declines in resident insects. In 2011 and 2012, I returned to my Luquillo study area and, using the same techniques I employed in 1975 and 1976, found a catastrophic collapse in insect populations with total biomass plummeting by 98%. In 2014 in the Chamela forest, my colleague Andres Garcia and I repeated insect samples we had taken in 1986 and 1987. Again we found major declines with biomass plummeting some 85%. Given these substantial decreases in insect prey we would expect simultaneous declines in forest insectivore such as lizards and frogs. In our Luquillo study area we documented a 50% decline in the biomass of insect eating Anolis lizards between 1975-1976 and 2011-2012. We also analyzed long term data on Luquillo forest frogs, the other major insectivore in the Luquillo forest, taken as part of the Luquillo LTER initiative, and found steep declines in frog numbers over 20 years in all four populations analyzed. To assess our hypothesis that climate warming was the causal variable behind declining insects and collapsing food webs, we employed two powerful techniques: hierarchical partitioning and Vinod causality. This research was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (Lister and Garcia, 2018) and recently won the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation Award for contributions to the preservation of the Earth\u2019s biodiversity.",

With support from the National Endowment for the Humanities, Vectors and a Fellowship in Digital Humanities at USC, Dr. Costelloe-Kuehn worked with Nick Shapiro to developing a platform using Geographic Information Systems to map the dispersal of formaldehyde-laden trailers originally deployed in the wake of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. The project has evolved into a Public Lab initiative replete with an online platform, a lending library a DIY formaldehyde test kit and a DIY remediation kit. With skills gained through graduate coursework in the RPI Arts Department, Dr. Costelloe-Kuehn has worked and volunteered at the Sanctuary for Independent Media, in Troy NY, as a critical media literacy educator, video editor and teacher with the DIY Animation Workshop. He has also taught video editing and produced content for the Journal of Cultural Anthropology, the Multispecies Salon and Capital District Community Gardens. Dr. Costelloe-Kuehn's zeal for STS was first sparked in 2002 at Vassar College, where he received departmental honors for his undergraduate thesis analyzing the work of Natalie Jeremijenko, drawing out possibilities for art and technology to animate social and environmental justice.",

    "biography": "Brett Fajen conducts research on perception and action. His main interests are the visual control of locomotion and perceptual-motor learning and adaptation. His research on these topics contributes to the development of the ecological and dynamical systems approaches to perception and action. \u201cIf you have ever been awed by the performance of a professional athlete, then you can appreciate some of the challenges that are faced when executing a skilled action,\u201d said Fajen. \u201cSuch tasks require rapid decision-making, anticipation, and coordination. In the Perception and Action Lab at RPI, my students and I use immersive virtual environments and motion capture technology to study how people navigate through complex, dynamic environments, and perform perceptual-motor skills such as running to catch a fly ball and blocking a penalty shot in soccer. We hope to inspire ideas for designing more sophisticated robots, develop new training programs for teaching complex motor skills, and improve the diagnosis and treatment of problems that affect the perceptual and motor systems.\u201d One current area of research is the \u201cRough Terrain Project,\u201d which investigates how humans and other animals are able navigate uneven terrain. In this project, Fajen and his students are exploring how visual information is used to walk over rough terrain with irregularly-spaced safe footholds. They have developed a novel experimental paradigm in which subjects walk over an array of randomly distributed virtual obstacles that are projected onto the floor by a LCD projector while their movements are recorded using a full-body motion capture system. This setup allows them to synchronize the appearance of obstacles with the movement of the subject. For example, in one experiment, obstacles appear only when they lie within a moving window of visibility centered on the subject. By manipulating the size of the window of visibility, they are measuring how far along the future path visual information is needed to control foot placement. As director of the Perception and Action (PandA) Laboratory, Fajen publishes regularly, with recent articles appearing in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, PLOS ONE, Perception, and the Handbook of Spatial Cognition. Fajen is the recipient of a four-year grant from the National Institutes of Health for a project titled \"The visual guidance of locomotion,\u201d and, in addition to his teaching and research, he is associate editor of Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance.",

Nominating Committee, National Academy of Sciences, 2011-2013 Long-range Planning Committee, Mineralogical Society of America, 2011 -- Research interests My research focuses on chemical phenomena that occur within the Earth and terrestrial planets, with emphasis on the outer 100 kilometers of the Earth. I use laboratory devices in the basement of the Jonsson-Rowland Science Center to achieve conditions of elevated pressure and temperature that exist within the Earth, and I conduct experiments designed to characterize fundamental materials properties and behavior at these conditions (my research could thus be described as \"materials science of the Earth\"). Measurements of interest include equilibrium partitioning (distribution) of the chemical elements and their isotopes among coexisting phases (crystals, silicate melts and supercritical fluids), as well as rates of reaction and especially diffusion. Broadly speaking, the goals of my work are to understand the internal workings of the Earth and terrestrial planets through experimentation and modeling, and to provide tools that will allow ourselves and other geoscientists to \"reverse engineer\" Earth materials to gain insight into our planet's history. My laboratory facilities and skill set are well suited to the study of all types of materials under pressure, which has led to fruitful collaborations with RPI researchers in the departments of Physics, Materials Science and Chemistry on topics ranging from RNA polymerization to high-pressure mechanical properties of glasses. As a member of RPI's Astrobiology Center, I developed a strong focus on characterizing the conditions of earliest Earth (4+ billion year ago)\u2015the stage upon which early life took hold. This interest will continue as a part-time theme in my research group; however, my interest in the fundamental basis of environmental proxies\u2014that is, chemical or isotopic signatures that inform us about past environments\u2015extends to the recent geological past and the use of knowledge gained from proxies to predict future trends.",

Our early work included algorithm development in protein structural bioinformatics, including structure prediction, contact map prediction, local structure prediction, hidden Markov models, sequence alignment, molecular surface area calculation, torsion space molecular dynamics, simplified representations for molecular dynamics, bioinformatics-driven force fields, structure-based alignment, and models for folding pathways. We proposed the \"phone cord effect\" to explain superhelicity in alpha helical crossovers. Starting about ten years ago, we began doing experimental work on green fluorescent protein (GFP) with the help of molecular biologist Prof. Donna E. Crone. We created a non-circularly permuted \"re-wired\" GFP, a permuted and truncated \"leave-one-out\" GFP, a variant that folds faster and more efficiently, and a GFP-base biosensor. We inserted strategically-placed disulfides to test specific hypotheses for the folding pathway of GFP and reasoned out the presence of two specific folding intermediates. More recently we are studying the formation of the fluorescent chromophore and the dependence of GFP fluorescence on specific residues and on thermodynamic stability. The principle thrust of the lab is to develop the leave-one-out (LOO) method for GFP-based biosensors. By combining computational design and high throughput screening, we find sets of mutations that complement a specific bound peptide and allow the truncated LOO-GFP to fold and glow only in the presence of a target protein which has been unfolded to expose that sequence. A biosensor for detection of H5N1 influenza virus hemagglutinin was published in 2015. We are collaborating on the development of a sensor for dengue virus and putting those sensors on protein fibers. We are also engaged in a collaborative effort to develop a contraceptive vaccine. The vaccine will produce temporary and reversible infertility. Instead of having to take an action to be protected, you will be protected by default, and would need to take an action to be temporarilly fertile again. The vaccine targets the sperm-specific calcium channel CatSper, which is required for sperm hyperactive motility and therefore for fertility. Sperm antigens are placed on the surface of non-infectious virus-like particles (VLP) for vaccination. A contraceptive vaccine is a humane way to deal with global overpopulation. Overpopulation is widely believed to be the root cause of anthropogenic climate change, overfishing, fresh water depletion, war, famine etc. -- in short, overpopulation is an existential threat. I recently published a computational model, called World4, for global population, predicting that a peak is coming soon. The good news is that by making every child a wanted child, population growth can be stopped humanely. My lab is using chimeric constructs of Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) L1 protein as a self-assmbling virus-like nanoparticle. Theses particle raise strong immunity to epitopes on their surface. We are placing CatSper loops on the surface for a contracpetive vaccine, SARS-CoV2 spike protein loops on the surface as a glycan-free COVID vaccine, and metastatic cancer biomarkers for a late-stage cancer immunotherapeutic. This versatile chimeric-HPV technology has many applications in epitope-directed vaccine design. This work was made possible by our collaborators, the Center for Computational Innovation (CCI), and Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Sciences (CBIS), and by grants from the NSF, NIH, Rosetta Commons, and a private foundation.",

My application areas cover a wide range of domain areas, but often in earth and space science informatics and health informatics.\u201d Her main research thrusts are in languages, tools, and environments for the semantic web. Deborah leads the Stanford Inference Web (IW) effort. Inference Web provides a framework for increasing trust in answers from heterogeneous systems by explaining how the answers were derived and what they depended on. Inference Web supports this goal by providing infrastructure and an implemented web-based environment for storing, exchanging, combining, annotating, comparing, search for, validating, and rendering proofs and proof fragments provided by reasoners and query answering systems. McGuinness is co-editor of the Ontology Web Language which has emerged from web ontology working group of the World Wide Web (W3C) semantic web activity and has now achieved W3C Recommendation status. She helped start the web ontology working group out of work as a co-author of the DARPA Agent Markup Language program's DAML language. She helped form the Joint EU/US Agent Markup Language Committee which evolved the DAML language into the oil-reference DAML OIL description logic-based ontology language. She is a co-author of one of the more widely used long-lived description logic systems (CLASSIC) from Bell Laboratories. Her work on languages (including OWL, oil-reference.html DAML OIL, OIL, CLASSIC, etc.) is aimed at providing languages that enable the next generation of web applications moving from a web aimed at human consumption to the semantic web aimed at machine consumption in support of intelligent assistants and web agents. Deborah is a leader in ontology-based tools and applications. She is a co-author and technical leader of the Stanford KSL ontology evolution environment.

Administrative leadership: Through his work as a University Center Director, previously as a School of Engineering Department head, and in professional societies he has successfully developed partnerships, Programs, and platforms, to drive translational scientific research across disciplines, sectors,and geographic boundaries. As Director of CBIS he oversees 70 resident and non-resident faculty (from each of the five Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute schools); engages with global partners in the public, private, and academic sectors; and fosters innovative graduate and undergraduate research and education initiatives. In his first two years as CBIS Director he has: envisioned and facilitated the creation of two transformative research centers (Bioimaging Center and Center for Translational Research in Medicine); led the development of an industry partners program to enhance technology transfer and commercialization; and broadened the scope of interdisciplinary research by combining biotechnology with architecture, humanities, and management. As Department Head of Biomedical Engineering (BME) in the School of Engineering at Rensselaer, in just 3 years he dramatically grew and strengthened the department: increased tenured faculty tenfold (1 to 10); added a senior endowed chair to its rank; and it became home to 7 NSF career awardees and recipient of more than 10 NIH RO1 awards (from 2 in 2009). As a committee member of the Orthopaedic Research Society, he developed and facilitated a \u201cSymposium in Translational Medicine\u201d designed to accelerate the transition of discoveries from lab bench to bedside by bridging the gap between clinical, basic science & engineering, government agencies (FDA) and industry. Research leadership: Dr. Vashishth\u2019s research interests are in the area of biomolecular science and engineering of extracellular matrix with particular emphasis on diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis and bone tissue engineering. His collaborative, interdisciplinary bone research is redefining how osteoporosis will be diagnosed and treated. In 2012 he was elected Fellow of the American Institute of Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE) for contributions to the understanding of how both age and collagen\u2010modification affect bone fragility (cited over 1000 times). AIMBE fellows represent the top 2% of the medical and biological engineering community in the world and are elected based on nomination and vote by AIMBE fellows ( http://aimbe.org/college-of-fellows/cof-1479/ ). He has opened new avenues for diagnosing and treating osteoporosis by developing a new technique to identify bone proteome from nanoscale samples. The process also has been applied for analyzing precious fossils.

    "biography": "Donald Drew earned his bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s, and doctoral degrees in mathematics from Rensselaer. In between his long tenure at the Institute, Drew conducted postdoctoral research at MIT, and taught for two years at New York University. Drew works in the area of multiphase flows, which are flows in which more than one material moves. Applications include sedimentation, boiling filtration and separation. A common example of the latter is the separation of a carbonated beverage and its \u201chead\u201d. It is an exciting area because of the complexity which can occur in such flows, and also because the simplest set of equations you can write are \u201cill-posed\u201d \u2014 flawed in a very fundamental way. Even though the simplest equations are incorrect in this way, many predictions obtained from them appear believable. Should the right equations be very different from the wrong ones? To try to answer this question, Drew is examining solutions of the equations which represent special physical phenomena in the flows and how sensitive the predictions are to the equations. The physical phenomena include the formation and propagation of \u201cstructures\u201d in the flow, such as shocks and transitions, including the interface between the beverage and its foamy \u201chead\u201d. There are some deep physical questions encountered along the way. Specifically, one wants to know how the equations appear in different coordinate systems. Since coordinate systems are human inventions, the materials cannot know one from another. This gives information about the form the equations can take. Another question involves the concepts of entropy and disorder. The motion of liquid flowing around a bubble has a \u201cdisorder\u201d in it on the scale of the bubble size, but this is vastly different than the thermal motions usually treated with thermodynamic ideas. On the other hand, this \u201cdisorder\u201d associated with the motion cannot all be reordered, or recovered, without some expenditure of energy. Drew feels that results in this important technological area can give insights in other areas of mechanics, for example, in the relation between gas dynamics and the dynamics of a large collection of gas molecules.",

    "biography": "Dr. Swank has been a member of the RPI faculty since 2005. He heads a dynamic, multidisciplinary laboratory of students, staff, and post-docs. His laboratory investigates how muscle is able to power an amazingly wide variety of locomotory tasks and modulate heart function. Research focuses in the lab include determining how variation between muscle fiber types (e.g. slow versus fast-contracting fibers) is generated, the mechanisms behind muscle mechanical properties such as stretch activation, and muscle diseases such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. An integrative approach is taken, starting with muscle genes and moving up in scale to protein expression and function, muscle mechanics, and whole organism studies. His research team primarily uses Drosophila for their studies, due to Drosophila's ease of genetic manipulation and mechanically testable muscles. However, we have recently started using mammalian muscle types to gain further insights. Dr Swank's lab has primarily focused on the role of myosin, the molecular motor that powers muscle contraction, in modulating muscle mechanical properties. Drosophila is currently the only system that can be transgenically manipulated to express a specific myosin isoform or mutant myosin in a specific muscle type. The expressed myosin can be isolated from Drosophila to measure single and ensemble biochemical and biophysical molecular properties such as ATPase rate and actin sliding velocity. Laboratory members also measure mechanical properties (e.g. power, velocity and force) of isolated muscle fibers expressing transgenic myosin and relate altered fiber properties to changes in locomotion, such as flight ability. Besides myosin, the laboratory also investigates the function of other muscle proteins such as muscle LIM protein (MLP), actin and troponin C. The lab investigates mechanisms behind several muscle and heart diseases such as familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and distal arthrogryposis. HCM is an inherited genetic disease that is the leading cause of sudden cardiac arrest among young adults. The lab creates transgenic Drosophila models of these diseases and perform experiments to determine how these disease states alter the mechanical function of muscle and tp provide insights into possible treatments.

Studies of crustal evolution:A major focus of my research group over the past three decades has been on the development of new techniques for the interpretation of metamorphic petrogenesis. These studies involve modeling mineral reactions, textures, and chemical zonation in both major and accessory phases. The goal of this work is to construct pressure-temperature-deformation-time histories that can be used to interpret the tectonic evolution of a terrane. We have applied these techniques to areas in the Alps, New England, southern Chile, the Mojave desert, British Columbia, the Adirondacks of New York, and the Cyclades Blueschist Belt of Greece. Current field projects are underway in Central New England The Ruby-Humboldt range of eastern Nevada Adirondack Mountains of New York Cyclades Blueschist Belt, Greece MetPetDB: A database for metamorphic geochemistry. The field of metamorphic petrology involves the collection of large amounts of data including sample characterization, field and thin section descriptions, photomicrographs of phase assemblages and reaction textures, SEM (backscatter secondary electron images of thin sections, X-ray maps depicting the distribution and zoning of elements in phases, cathodoluminescence images of phases such as zircon or quartz to reveal trace element zoning, as well as analyses of whole-rock and mineral chemistry and isotope abundances. Managing such large quantities of data is a large effort and preserving these data for the future is not yet routine except for the small amounts that see their way into publication. MetPetDB (Metamorphic Petrology Database) is an NSF-funded project involving collaboration between metamorphic petrologists and computer scientists at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with an international working group. The goal is the development of an informatics system that will prove to be a valuable resource for both the preservation of valuable data as well as serving as a platform for new, innovative research directions.

    "biography": "The unique strengths of our laboratory involve development of NMR methods and software for analysis of protein structures and dynamics, and in applying these methods in structure-function studies. As Director of the NIGMS-funded Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium (NESG) for 16 years (2000 - 2016), we lead a team that determined more than 1,200 3D structures by X-ray crystallography and NMR methods. Over the course of this project we developed expertise in protein expression and crystallization, and in reconstitution and structure determination of soluble proteins and membrane-associated lipoproteins. We also developed extensive experience in software development, creating a cost-efficient pipeline for protein sample and structure production, achieving the NIGMS project goal of total cost per structure deposited in the PDB of ~$50,000. Our laboratory research program revolves around the themes of new technology development for protein sample production and computational analysis. Based on our experience as a central node for protein sample production and structure determination by NMR in the NIGMS PSI program, rigorous structure and dynamic analysis of small (<15 kDa) proteins in our laboratory is largely automated and routine. However, most of our current research program focus on larger (>20 kDa), more challenging systems, including integral membrane proteins and protein complexes. The group's biomedical focus areas include structure-function studies of proteins and complexes involved in cancer biology, and both influenza and SARS CoV2 virus infection. These projects require hybrid approaches, combining NMR data with X-ray crystallography, SAXS, paramagnetic NMR and EPR, and other biophysical methods, along with advanced computational modeling and structural bioinformatics. In order to ensure rigor in applying this broad range of methods, we collaborate intensively with internationally-recognized experts in these domains. For example, we work with experts to explore the impact of Evolutionary Coupling (C. Sander, D. Marks), Rosetta (D. Baker), and CHARMM (W. Im) modeling methods for determining 3D structures of larger proteins for which only sparse, incomplete experimental data is available, including integral membrane proteins. We rely on our collaborators for SAXS (J. Tainer), fluorescence spectroscopy (C. Royer), and cryoEM (J. Hunt, K. Das) data, and to provide expertise in these critical experimental methods. We also lead the structural biology components of several biomedical collaborations, including projects on viral-host protein/RNA interactions of murine leukemia (with M. Roth, Rutgers) and influenza (with S. Patel, Rutgers) viruses, SARS-CoV2 antiviral drug development (with A. Garcia-Sastre, Mt. Sinai), DNA damage repair (with S. Bunting, Rutgers), and de novo protein design (with D. Baker, U Wash.). We also collaborate with the Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) program to organize efforts in sparse-NMR-guided structure prediction across the CASP community, and with the wwPDB to develop robust and rigorous methods of protein and nucleic acid structure quality assessment. All of these collaborations are aimed at ensuring the highest rigor and quality control, and in addressing important biomedical questions. Our laboratory has trained more than 45 graduate students and postdocs, and more than 100 undergraduate students. Many of these have gone on to leading positions in industry and academics. Several are professors at research universities. Others have scientist or management positions at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. A list of laboratory alumni, and their current positions, is available on our lab home page. https://montelionelab.chem.rpi.edu/about/alumni.htm Montelione is recipient of numerous awards and honors including the Damon Runyon-Walter Winchell Cancer Research Fellow; Searle Scholar Award; Johnson & Johnson Research Discovery Award; American Cyanamid Award in Physical and Analytical Chemistry; National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award; Proctor and Gamble Young Investigator Award; Camille Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar Award; Rutgers University Board of Trustees Award for Scholarly Excellence; Biophysical Society Michael and Kate B\u00e1r\u00e1ny Award for Young Investigators; Elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) ; Inaugural Jerome and Lorraine Aresty Endowed Chair, Rutgers University; and Endowed Constellation Chair in Structural Bioinformatics, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He has published > 350 peer-reviewed papers, with > 20,000 citations and an impact H-index of 77. With Prof. G. Wagner (Michigan), Montelione carried out pioneering work on NMR pulse sequence development, including the design and implementation of the first triple-resonance protein NMR experiments, as well as the high-impact ZZ-exchange and J1-resolved E_COSY experiments. At Rutgers, he followed up this work by development of the HCCNH-TOCSY, HCCcoNH-TOCSY, and related widely-adopted triple-resonance NMR experiments. Montelione has made key contributions in computational NMR methods development, including the development of software for automated analysis of protein resonance assignments, automated analysis of 3D structures, and for protein NMR model quality assessment. Work with R. Krug on the influenza A non-structural protein 1 (NS1) has provided the basis for creation of attenuated virus vaccines, that are now in clinical trials.",

After a short postdoc he worked on character recognition and remote sensing at IBM Yorktown (and claims credit for IBM's growth during this period). During a reverse sabbatical at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al he recorded pulse trains from cats' medial geniculate nuclei. In 1972 he was appointed chairman of the Department of Computer Science at the University of Nebraska where he dabbled in computational geometry, GIS and HCI, and was eventually inducted in the NHC. Since 1985 he has been Professor of Computer Engineering at RPI in Troy, NY. Nagy's credits in document analysis include Chinese character recognition with Dick Casey, \"self-corrective\" character recognition with Glen Shelton (with a reprise twenty-eight years later with Henry Baird), character recognition via cipher substitution with Casey, Sharad Seth, and Tin Ho, growing X-Y trees with Seth, table interpretation with Dave Embley, Mukkai Krishnamoorthy, Dan Lopresti and Seth, modeling random-phase noise with Prateek Sarkar and Lopresti, style-constrained classification with Sarkar, Harsha Veeramachaneni, Hiromichi Fujisawa and Cheng-Lin Liu, and paper-based election systems research with Lopresti and Elisa Barney Smith. He tries to keep up with the state of the art by learning new ideas from former students. He is a Fellow of the IEEE and the IAPR, and received prematurely (in 2001) the ICDAR Lifetime Contributions Award. In his spare time Nagy enjoys skiing, sailing, and writing prolix surveys.

In both cases I have been instrumental in elucidating their substructure. I hope that these studies will contribute to our understanding of how the Galaxy formed. In addition, the stellar substructure in both the halo and in the disk can be used to determine where dark matter is located in the Milky Way galaxy. I currently run MilkyWay@home . I am also working on a telescope design that uses a giant diffraction grating to collect light instead of a large mirror; this design might allow a giant, light-weight telescope to be unfurled in space. You can follow my research on facebook , twitter , instagram and YouTube . More information on past accomplishments can be found on Wikipedia . A full list of my publications, provided by the NASA/ADS Abstract Server, can be found here: BIBLIOGRAPHY . I was a participant in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey , from 1992 to 2008. This survey imaged 10,000 square degrees of the north Galactic cap in five optical filters. Additionally, it obtained a million spectra of the galaxies (and hundreds of thousands of QSOs and stars) that were detected in the imaging survey. I am also a participant in the Chinese LAMOST spectral survey of millions of Galactic stars, and led the US participation (Participants in LAMOST, US -- PLUS) in the design of that survey. I have worked in many areas of astronomy over the course of my career. I did my PhD with the Berkeley Automated Supernova Search, which measured the supernova rates as a function of supernova type in Virgo-distance galaxies; and the Supernova Cosmology Project, which is measuring the cosmological parameters Omega and Lambda using the light curves of distant supernovae. I have published papers in diverse areas of galactic and extragalactic astronomy, including: supernova phenomenology, measuring cosmological parameters from supernovae, galaxy photometry, color selection of QSOs, properties of stars, and the structure of our galaxy.",

Prof. Shelley\u2019s current research interests lie in the development of new hardware and software tools for mass spectrometry, which enable rapid and sensitive detection and identification of analytes in complex matrices. Specifically, his group approaches these tasks through development , fundamental characterization , and application of instrumentation. Currently, Prof. Shelley\u2019s group is aiming to expand the capabilities of ambient mass spectrometry through added dimensionality of analysis without compromising the speed of the analysis. The goal is to develop an ionization source, which operates at atmospheric pressure that can provide molecular, structural, and atomic information of species present on a sample surface. Overall, this research addresses a major focus of modern analytical chemistry \u2013 rapid, in situ detection of relevant compounds without the need for sample modification or a priori information of sample constituents. Such methods of analysis are needed in a wide range of areas including homeland security, drug development and production, chemical synthesis, and environmental analyses.",

    "biography": "Dr. Kilduff's research interests include application of membrane and adsorption separation processes to potable water production, industrial wastewater treatment, and pollutant transport in the environment. His research projects involve: * Using ultrafiltration and nanofiltration membrane separation processes to control natural organic matter, including disinfection by-product precursors, and ionic pollutants * The effects of macromolecule size and sorbent chemical characteristics on the uptake of natural organic matter by activated carbon * The effects of background natural organic matter on the removal of trichloroethylene by activated carbon * The effects of activated carbon surface properties on the uptake of priority pollutants and the solvent regeneration of phenol. In one line of investigation, Kilduff and his group are developing membrane processes for potable water production. Although such processes are becoming more widely accepted and economical, membrane fouling still remains a significant problem. With Yanxiao Yuan, Kilduff is investigating the role of mixtures of polysaccarides, humic and fulvic acids, and inorganic colloids (including nanoparticles) on membrane flux and flux decline. Their objectives include the development of predictive models and operational strategies to minimize flux decline. With Mingyan Zhou, they are looking at how membrane properties such as surface morphology, RMS roughness, and feature size contribute to flux decline. They are collaborating with the Belfort group at RPI to developing ways to minimize flux decline via modification of membrane surface chemistry using UV-assisted graft polymerization of hydrophilic and charged monomers. Mingyan is leading an innovative approach employing high throughput technology borrowed from the biotechnology industry. The membrane group is also interested in developing ways to predict membrane rejection of natural organic matter and EPA candidate compounds using hindered transport models combined with the Nernst-Planck equation to account for solute and membrane charge. In a second line of investigation, with Hyung Nam Lim Kilduff and his group are studying the role of adsorption in natural and engineered systems. With application to natural systems, soil and sediment organic matter plays a major role in the sorption and desorption of polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Such organic matter may coat mineral surfaces and may be adsorbed in nanometer-sized pore spaces. They are investigating the role of such confinement on sorption and desorption equilibrium; this research has application to risk assessment and remediation strategies. With application to water and wastewater treatment, they are investigating the efficacy of carbon nanotubes as adsorbents for organic compounds. This research involves developing ways to pretreat nanotubes to remove metal catalysts, ways to etch nanotubes using advanced oxidation processes to open internal surface area, ways to assess and control aggregation. Their objectives include the thermodynamic modeling of sorption equilibrium and identification of mechanisms including the role of pi-pi interactions.",

Her ethnographic research extends a political ecology approach to questions about the precarious relationships, practices, and discourse at the intersection of community and environmental, economic and sociocultural sustainability. She teaches methodological and conceptual tools to understand local meanings and practices in the context of global systems. This attention to the local within the global frame includes a commitment to support inclusive sustainability initiatives. Jennifer\u2019s upcoming publications and current book project examine the relationship between consumption-driven migration, environmental conservation, agriculture, nonprofit organizations, and community development in small town on the southern Jalisco, Mexico coast. This stretch of coast is experiencing a transition as much of the beach-front land is being privatized for luxury resort development with claims of environmental sustainability. In the community Jennifer worked with, on the other hand, the concept of sustainability is materializing in an alternative locally-directed community development. This research explores how different environmental ideologies converge and produce frictions in divergent sustainable development practices. The local and international collaborative research projects Jennifer has designed in the US, Iceland, and the UK bring a commitment to inclusive community engagement that integrates teaching with research on human/environment relationships. At Earlham College in Richmond, Indiana, Jennifer\u2019s multidisciplinary student/faculty collaborative research team assessed local needs and assets, and designed an interactive resource guide in a project funded through the Earlham Center for Social Justice. Student researchers took the leading role in directing the project to ensure that it would be inclusive, accessible, and useful to community residents. This project built on research into local sustainability initiatives in the UK and using a model team members explored in London, resulted in a proposal to open a free Library of Things in collaboration with the municipal library in Richmond. Jennifer\u2019s current research explores the ways Troy, NY residents are navigating, initiating, and challenging change- including intersections of local development initiatives and global climate change. She is studying viable, equitable alternatives and possibilities for maneuvering precarity with a focus on water and food. This local ethnographic research will build on a larger comparative project integrating research on grassroots sustainable development in sites in Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States (including drinking water access and resources such as geothermal hot springs, urban and rural farming, and sustainable tourism initiatives).",

Her research has made contributions to military logistics, distribution and transportation systems, healthcare logistics, on-demand supply chains, and peer-to-peer resource sharing systems. To close the gap between current distribution operations and customer expectations, a recent focus of her team is rethinking supply chain design to meet the demands of modern distribution. For more information, please see Dr. Pazour's publications and website: https://jenpazour.wordpress.com/ Jen fundamentally considers herself a modeler, whose core intellectual strength is in the development of mathematical representations of complex systems and processes to better understand the implications of their design and operation. Thus, her research approach is (1) to develop models encompassing the primary trade-offs in the system, (2) to understand structural properties and to discover solution approaches to solve the models, and then (3) to conduct experiments that use the developed models and approaches to provide policy recommendations and managerial insights. Military Logistics: Sea-basing is a strategy implemented by the United States Military that allows the Joint Forces to be supported from the sea. From a logistics perspective, sea-basing will transform a set of vessels into floating distribution centers that are responsible for fulfilling supply orders from troops on shore. Sea-based logistics operate in a challenging and uncertain environment and have unique mission characteristics; consequently, sea-based logistics require the development of specific logistics models. Through a Young Investigator Award from the Office of Naval Research, Dr. Pazour's team of graduate and undergraduate researchers conducted research on the design of responsive sea-based logistics delivery systems with imperfect visibility. In doing so, they developed descriptive models to characterize and to understand how and why cargo holds evolve from a highly organized state to a disorganized state. Given imperfect information about the location, quantity, and expected delivery requests, the research team developed prescriptive models to determine which items, and in what quantity, should be pre-staged on the flight deck. They then use their developed models, solution algorithms, and structural results to quantify and evaluate logistics system design, to analyze the trade-offs associated with operating in a complex and uncertain environment, and to inform direction for future technology and process innovations. Peer-to-Peer Resource Sharing Systems: A novel way to increase resource efficiency is through the use of existing, idle capacity. A Peer-to-Peer Resource Sharing System is one where a resource owned by an individual is collectively shared with a group of users. The shared resource can be a physical resource (like a power drill) or a human resource (like the ability to perform a task). Peer-to-Peer Resource Sharing Systems are one aspect of the sharing economy and collaborative consumption. A long-term research goal is to improve understanding of Peer-to-Peer Resource Sharing Systems through the development and use of novel mathematical models. Intial funding of this work is through a National Science Foundation EAGER grant. A Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant from NSF supports her research focusing on novel methods to coordinate decentralized distribution resources on-demand through customized recommendations made to multiple suppliers simultaneously and to quantify the impact of supplier choice on platform efficiency, effectiveness, and equity. Distribution and Transportation Systems: Dr. Pazour's research in distribution systems includes analyzing automated storage and retrievals systems with multiple pick points in the aisle, batch processes in stock-to-picker order-fulfillment systems, reshuffling policies for warehouses, and pallet management strategies. This research has been funded by a Material Handling Institute Start-Up Grant. Research on transportation has focused on the design of a high-speed rail network for freight distribution in the United States, the development of an improved routing and scheduling methodology that has been successfully implemented at J.B. Hunt Transport, and development of models to analyze and recommend policies in rental vehicle networks (awarded an honorable mention for best applications paper in the 2016 IIE Transactions Focused Issue on Design and Manufacturing). Healthcare Logistics: Dr. Pazour's dissertation research focused on analytical modeling and understanding the impact of piece-level, order-ful llment technology in the pharmaceutical supply chain and was supported through a Doctoral Dissertation Enhancement Project from the National Science Foundation. Her research was strongly guided by involvement with the University of Arkansas's Center for Innovation in Healthcare Logistics, which provided access to numerous healthcare facilities, data, and experts. Her research has been funded through a National Science Foundation Early Career Development (CAREER) grant (2018), a Johnson & Johnson WiSTEM2D fellowship (2018), a National Academies of Science Engineering and Medicine Gulf Research Program Early-Career Research Fellowship (2016), a Startup Grant from the Material Handling Institute (2014), a Young Investigator Award from the Office of Naval Research (2013), a Doctoral Dissertation Enhancement Project from the National Science Foundation (2010), and national fellowships from Tau Beta Pi (2006), the Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers (IISE) (2005, 2007, 2009), and the Material Handling Education Foundation (2007 \u2013 2010).

In particular he was involved in the early studies of \"center dominance\" and Z(N) vortices. String compactifications in weakly coupled heterotic string theory. He worked on Z(3) orbifolds and computed the particle spectra and low energy phenomenology of these modes, after conducting systematic scans. This included work on CP violation, gauge coupling unification, moduli stabilization and neutrino masses. Supersymmetric lattice field theory. Here methods of reducing or eliminating fine-tuning were explored. He continues to work actively in this field and is conducting detailed studies of N=1 and N=4 super-Yang-Mills. For N=1 he is using domain wall fermions, and is currently working on obtaining the ground state spectrum. In the case of N=4, some fine-tuning must be performed even in the so-called \"twisted\" formulation, and he is studying this using Monte Carlo renormalization group techniques. Lattice technicolor theories were a focus of his research until the recent discovery of the Higgs boson, and subsequent results for its signal strengths to various final states disfavored composite Higgs models, as compared to models where the Higgs boson is an elementary scalar and decays according to the standard model in a natural way. However, he continues to work on studies of theories with an infrared fixed point, and is currently focused on corrections to scaling. The impact of lattice quantum chromodynamic studies on the search for dark matter. In particular, he showed how estimates of the direct detection cross section should be revised in light of lattice estimates of the strange quark sigma term. Scalar mesons in quantum chrmodynamics, especially the sigma particle. He has been developing efficient techniques for extracting its properties.

    "biography": "Johannes Goebel joined Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute as Founding Director of the Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center (EMPAC) in July 2002. He holds a tenured position as Professor in the Arts Department and in the School of Architecture. Between 1990 and 2002, Goebel was the Founding Director of the Institute for Music and Acoustics at the Zentrum f\u00fcr Kunst und Medientechnologie (ZKM) in Karlsruhe, Germany. With its studios, artist-in-residence program, productions, commissions and festivals, he established the Institute as one of the leading production environments worldwide for \"music and technology\". For ZKM's new building, which opened in 1996 and comprises two museums, two research and production institutes, studios and performance venues, Goebel coordinated the overall demands for the ZKM building and specified the requirements and infrastructure of ZKM's performance spaces and the Institute for Music and Acoustics. Under his directorship, more than 90 international artists produced roughly two-hundred works at the Institute, ranging from compositions with live and interactive electronics to pure sound synthesis, interactive operas and radio plays, sound installations, ballet music and music films with live orchestras. A continuous performance program and co-productions with other festivals established the Institute as a center for new practices in music. During his tenure at ZKM, Goebel lectured and published internationally on aesthetics, technology and music, co-directed 1996 Stanford University's Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA), taught a summer course at the Catholic University Porto, Portugal in 2000, and was a guest professor at the Music Academy Graz, Austria, in 1992. Two key research projects at ZKM during Goebel's leadership include the establishment of the International Digital Electro-Acoustic Music Archive (IDEAMA). This endeavor was also led by Max Mathews, the \"father of music compilers,\" and Patte Wood from Stanford University. After an extended collaboration between Stanford and ZKM, the first digital archive of electronic music up to the 1970s was complete and became a major resource of early electronic music. The archive holds nearly 550 works and is currently available in 23 libraries and music institutes around the world. The next key project Goebel conducted, as principal investigator with a team of experts, developed and applied hardware and software to record and transcribe the music for the Balinese shadow play, Gender Wayang . In 1975, he began his work as a curator by establishing the Hohe-Ufer-Konzerte in Hannover, Germany. At that time, it was a major initiative to establish a platform for a program that crossed and integrated composition, improvisation, literature, theater, dance and visual arts. He collaborated with Gunter Lege and Guenther Christmann. Goebel has since been active in programming and collaborating with festivals and institutions. In 1989, he was Founding Curator of ZKM's media-festival MultiMediale, initiating ZKM's artistic activities. As a composer, Goebel wrote pieces for traditional instruments, his own instruments, computer synthesis and the live and electronic environment of the experimental studio at the Strobel-Stiftung Freiburg. He collaborated in numerous intermedia projects and interdisciplinary performances with dancers, actors, architects, performance and visual artists. Between 1977 and 1990, Goebel's activities stretched between the United States and Europe. In 1977, he started in the field of computer music at Stanford University's Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA) with a two year grant from the German Academic Exchange Service DAAD. As a visiting composer, he was a regular guest at CCRMA until 1990 and he initiated several major projects. In Europe, he worked as composer, teacher, instrument designer, curator and musician. In the 1970s, Germany was the only country of the western industrialized nations that did not have a center or studio for music with computers. This slowly changed in the 1980s. Johannes Goebel was at that time the only composer moving continuously between the Silicon Valley and Germany trying to create a bridge between technical advances and the German contemporary music attitudes. In 1983, he conducted the first workshop for German composers at CCRMA, Stanford University. His lectures on the topic of computer music were slowly accepted and he continuously strived to establish a German artistically based approach to computer and music application. ZKM provided the basis for establishing a studio with international relevance. While composing music with computers in the USA, Goebel designed and constructed wood and metal instruments in Europe including mallets with non-traditional tuning systems, a huge walk-in organ pipe etc. Between 1970 and 1990, he was very active in the field of free improvisation with non-traditional instruments. As member of a group including his mentor Gunter Lege, Goebel conducted more than 450 free improvisation workshops for students ranging from kindergarten to university age. Goebel began teaching music at public schools and colleges at the age of 21. Until his position at ZKM in 1990 required from him to stop continuous teaching, he taught in very diverse environments. He taught computer music to professionals, free improvisation to children starting at the age of 3, adults up to 60+ and conservatory students. He also taught music theory, conducting and interdisciplinary artistic production as Professor at the University Hildesheim and worked intensively with physically and mentally handicapped children. As consultant to Schott Musik International, one of the largest music publishing houses worldwide, Goebel conducted the overall changeover from traditional music engraving to electronic music printing in 1988 through 1990. In cooperation with the German avant-garde record label Wergo, Goebel initialized the first Audio-CD series utilizing this new digital medium for Digital Music Digital in 1986. As producer, coordinator, digital audio editor and editor-in-chief, he published in collaboration with Max Mathews and CCRMA Computer Music Currents, a 13-volume CD series focused mainly on computer music of the 1980s. The final volume, The Historical CD of Digital Sound Synthesis , is a collection of the very first computer-synthesized pieces from the late 1950s and early 1960s. Goebel also established the music devision of edition zkm during his time at ZKM. This series serves as a forum for works produced at the Institute for Music and Acoustics. The Audio-CD and DVD series is published by Wergo, the books by Schott Musik International.",

One particular current area is in sparse and low-rank optimization, especially in the use of exact complementarity formulations. Sparse formulations occur in, for example, compressed sensing and genome-wide association studies. Low-rank optimization is also used in some problems in compressed sensing and also in statistics and in financial optimization. Current application areas of particular interest are in effective resource allocation in disaster management and humanitarian logistics, looking both at preparation and mitigation for a potential disaster, and in recovery from a disaster. He also looks at the related area of designing resilient supply chains.",

Hart Professor, and Director of the Center for Infrastructure, Transportation, and the Environment; and the Volvo Research and Educational Foundations (VREF) Center of Excellence on Sustainable Urban Freight Systems at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He received his B.Sc. in Civil Engineering, Magna Cum Laude, from the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, in 1981; his M.Sc. from the Universidad Central de Venezuela in 1984; and his Ph.D. from The University of Texas at Austin in 1996. He has been a faculty at California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo, City College of New York (1997-2002), and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (2002-present). His work has received numerous awards, including the 2013 White House Champion of Change Award for his contributions to freight transportation and disaster response. His research emphasizes the integration, synthesis, and projection of the knowledge that exist in multiple disciplines to produce solutions to the complex and multifaceted problems\u2014which have proven to be too complex to be solved by single-disciplinary approaches\u2014that impact freight transportation and humanitarian logistics. His research taps into the knowledge of social sciences to build more realistic mathematical models of humanitarian logistics, and integrate cutting edge economic principles into freight transportation modeling, so that a complete picture could be developed on the broader impacts of transportation activity on the economy and the environment; and on the most effective ways to conduct post-disaster humanitarian logistics. His research blends field research and measurements, applied and basic research to ensure that theory relates to reality; and, ultimately, to a set of actionable policy recommendations that contribute to the betterment of the economy and society. Current research activities focus on three major areas: freight transportation demand modeling, sustainable freight policy, and humanitarian logistics. His work on freight demand modeling focuses on enhancing the realism of spatial price equilibrium (SPE) models, and development of simplified modeling techniques. His work on sustainable freight policy studies the interactions between the agents (e.g., shippers, carriers, receivers) involved in freight activity, to define ways to exploit these interactions to foster sustainable development and operations. An important third area, of profound human impact, focuses on the development of novel forms of humanitarian logistics. His research group has pioneered the multidisciplinary study of post-disaster humanitarian logistic operations. His research has: identified the key lessons learned from the response to the largest disasters of recent times; translated these lessons into actionable policy recommendations; and shared these suggestions with disaster response agencies. As part of the field work, his research group has conducted detailed analyses of the most prominent disasters of recent times, including: Hurricane Katrina, the Port-au-Prince earthquake, the tornadoes in Joplin and Alabama, Hurricane Irene, and the Tohoku disasters in Japan. His contributions to the solution of regional and national problems are numerous as they span modeling, policy, and research. In particular, his ability to transition research into practice\u2014navigating complex implementation environments\u2014has been recognized with appointments to prestigious positions. As a member of the Board of the New York State Thruway Authority\u2014as the only researcher and Hispanic American in the board\u2019s history\u2014he helps oversee toll policy and the replacement of the $4 billion Tappan Zee Bridge, one of the largest construction projects in the US. He is overseeing all-electronic-toll-collection, toll setting, financing, asset management, and helps the agency reach a higher level of efficiency. His policy contributions also cover disaster response; as a member of the National Academy of Sciences\u2019 Disaster Research Roundtable, he advises the federal government in disaster response on the basis of his field research after large disasters and catastrophic events. He has been member of numerous panels for the National Academy of Sciences\u2019 Transportation Research Board, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and other agencies. His research, routinely implemented by practitioners, has been impactful. His work on freight generation and freight trip generation has led to the development of freight trip generation models\u2014to be incorporated in the next edition of the ITE Trip Generation Manual\u2014that are more accurate than any currently available. Equally transformative has been his research on freight tour models, freight origin-destination estimation, and others that are being incorporated into transportation modeling packages such as TRANSCAD, TRANUS, among others. One of his most visible contributions is the NYC off-hour-delivery project, which is having a transformative effect on urban freight policy. This project has blossomed into a potent freight demand management tool that has won the enthusiastic support of the private sector. It is estimated to lead to economic savings of 100-200/million dollars per year, and reductions of: 202.7 metric tons (t)/year of CO, 40t/year of HC, 11.8t/year of NOx, and 69.9 kg/year of PM10). Recognizing these significant impacts, the City of New York adopted OHD as part of its sustainability plan, and the Federal Highway Administration created a program to foster OHD, based on the one pioneered in NYC, and to replicate it in other US cities. Because of its impacts, TIME magazine identified off-hour deliveries as one of the \u201c10 Ideas that Make a Difference\u201d in traffic congestion. His leadership positions include: President of the Scientific Committee of the Pan-American Conferences of Traffic and Transportation Engineering, member of the Scientific Committee of the World Conference of Transport Research, Elected Member of the Council for the Association for European Transport, member of the International Organizing Committee of the City Logistics Conferences, member of technical committees at numerous professional organizations, and member of the editorial boards of the leading journals.

For some time, she has been investigating cultural perceptions of fact and fiction and is currently exploring their status within a political context. In Consuming Reality: The Commercialization of Factual Entertainment (Palgrave Macmillan, 2012), Deery demonstrates how reality television monetizes and consumes reality through its branding of content and propagation of capitalist narratives. Among other things, she examines the professionalization of individual identities and social relationships, the development of television as a social and interactive medium, and the commodification of viewers and TV participants. Reality TV (Polity, 2014) provides an overview of the impact of reality television since its inception and its contribution to discussions of gender, class, race, celebrity, audience agency, and consumer identity. The book also continues to explore cultural understandings of factuality and realism. Deery also co-edited (with Andrea Press) Media and Class: TV, Film, and Digital Culture (Routledge, 2017). In this collection, a range of prominent British and American scholars address topics such as class as entertainment, labor relations and media production, and digital celebrity.

Dr. Rogers completed her PhD in Earth and Planetary Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis, with previous degrees awarded from Stanford University (M.S. 2001) and Harvard University (A.B. 1996). Dr. Rogers is a member of the New York Center for Astrobiology (NYCA) and the Institute for Data Exploration and Applications (IDEA). Dr. Rogers\u2019 research focuses on the relationships between microbial communities and environmental conditions in extreme ecosystems, and is broadly applied to understanding the nature of the origin of life on Earth, the potential for life throughout the solar system, and the extent of life in modern extreme environments. To advance our understanding of environmental microbiomes in these systems, Dr. Rogers research program includes field research in early Earth and Mars analog environments as well as laboratory experimental studies of microbial behavior under extreme conditions. Additionally, the group is exploring the viability of abiotic synthesis of biomolecules over a range of early Earth conditions. The driving question in this research is how realistic environmental conditions combine to form habitable niches that can both support the early emergence of life as well as the long-term survival of life in these environments. Dr. Rogers\u2019 fieldwork includes several terrestrial hydrothermal systems including Cerro Negro Volcano, Nicaragua, the Vulcano shallow marine hydrothermal system in Italy, and several modern deep-sea mid-ocean ridge environments. These field endeavors are combined with extensive laboratory analytical and experimental techniques to develop a holistic picture of functional microbial ecosystems. More specifically, laboratory techniques include cultivation of extremophiles under high pressure, high temperature, acidic, and anaerobic conditions; a next-generation genomics approach to determine the functional environmental microbiome in extreme systems; geochemical analyses and modeling of environmental and bioenergetics parameters; and the synthesis of these datasets using novel data analytics.

    "biography": "Pacific Northwest native Kenneth Ragsdale is an Albany, NY based artist. His work, derived from personal memories; is process driven, focused on narrative, and involves a mixture of many artistic disciplines: drawing, painting, sculpture, paper-craft, theatre lighting, and photography. His recent work deals specifically with his own childhood narrative and it's metaphorical relationship with that of the growth of America as a nation. \"I associate reality with transience, and to the building up of memories, rather than with the concreteness of my present existence. What I think I remember is in a constant state of flux, the organization and arrangement of particulars controlled and altered by every new experience, to the point where even the mundane can be reformed into the epic. All of my work is made with the intention to examine what remains of the actual, reveal the process of alteration, and explore the possibilities of the fantastic. Every remembrance is a reinvention, and reality is not fixed, but in process.\" Though normally concerned with finding new and innovative ways of manufacturing a 2-dimensional image, Kenneth has recently altered the scope of his work to encompass the aspects of installation, human scale interaction, and collaborative curatorial projects. He is currently working in collaboration with associate professor Michael Oatman from the RPI School of Architecture on a multi-discipline project, which will pay homage to 'The Armory Show' of 1913 and to the history of its effect on the artistic life of the Capital Region. He has exhibited in many galleries, museums and arts venues, including: Cypriana Majernika Gallery, Bratislava, Slovakia, The High Line, New York, NY, Siena College, Loudonville, NY, Albany International Airport, Albany, NY, Amrose Sable Gallery, Albany, NY, Johnson Memorial Art Gallery, Middlebury College, Middlebury, VT, Arts Center of the Capital Region, Troy, NY, Sicyon Gallery, Walla Walla, WA, Rochester Contemporary Arts Center, Rochester, NY, Froelick Gallery, Portland, OR, Rockingham Arts & Museum Project, Bellows Falls, VT, Portland Institute for Contemporary Art, Portland, OR, and Del Mano Gallery, Los Angeles, CA.

He also explores related empirical topics, including the frequency of disruptive technological change, the ability of new information technologies to provide advantage to upstart companies, estimation methods for the need for environmentally beneficial technologies, and the mechanisms by which corporate governance changes affect firm productivity. \u201cA succession of research papers has probed the causes of shakeouts and rejected many hypothetical (often popular) theories,\u201d Simons said. \u201cInstead, a few early entrants with the right skills and backgrounds benefit from a spiral of advantage that helps them become dominant market leaders while other firms are driven to extinction.\u201d His ongoing project on disruptive technological change, funded by the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation and the National Science Foundation, is apparently the largest-scale data collection project on disruptive technological change ever attempted, spanning about 100 industries over more than 100 years.

    "biography": "Dr. Cheng Hsu is Professor of Industrial and Systems Engineering and Professor of Information Technology, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY12180-3590. He earned a Ph.D. degree from the Ohio State University in Management Sciences (with a minor in Computer Science), MS in Industrial and Systems Engineering from Ohio State University, and BS in Industrial Engineering from Tunghai University, Taiwan. He served on Rensselaer's Faculty Council, Faculty Senate, and various other academic committees at the school and institute levels (e.g., the Institute-wide BS-IT and MS-IT curricula committees). He has been a keynote speaker to a number of international meetings in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Thailand, Italy, and Canada, as well as in the US. Dr. Hsu is currently engaging in research on service science, with a focus on service design and system design. He developed a thoery of Digital Connections Scaling to help explain the dynamics of new service in the connected world. The theory recognizes population-wide connected value cocreation among persons and organizations as a transforming mode of production for Knowledge Economy, and thereby analyzes new busness designs and service system design laws. A new model accompanies the theory: Hyper-Networks, which engages the emerging network science to provide insights into the analytic nature of connected value cocreation. New system design methods aim at helping scale IS up to the populations of customers, providers, and resources; down to individual users; and transformational to cross-sectional collaboration. The theory is also suported by such results as instrumentation of the environments (using, e.g., RFID systems, wireless sensor networks), Cyber-Infrastructure-Assisted Enterprises, and the market approach to open and scalable information exchange. He is a believer of person-centered models on the Internet. In addition to the above original work on serfvice science, Dr. Hsu is also devoted to studying sustainability design for products and production systems, and alternative energy system design for micro grids at the community level. The originator of the Metadatabase and Two-Stage Entity-Relationship Models, Dr. Hsu's work have contributed to much of the research on these topics as reported in this Web site, Enterprise Integration and Modeling. He has been a principal investigator of Rensselaer's Computer-Integrated Manufacturing and Adaptive Integrated Manufacturing programs, and a number of other government- and industry-sponsored projects. The sponsors include companies such as Alcoa, Digital, GE, GM, IBM, and Samsung Electronics, and government sources such as the U.S. National Science Foundation, Army Research, New York State, and NATO. Dr. Hsu teaches Multi-disciplinary Capstone Engineering Design, Discrete Systems Simulation, Databases, e-Business engineering, and Information Systems. His publications include a number of books and edited volumes, and over a hundred scholarly papers in a number of archivaljournals and proceedings. He is a member of AIS, IEEE and ASEE.

We study the internal structure of the cell, the cytoskeleton, and how it is organized to generate and maintain the complex 3D shape of differentiated cells. We also study how cells interact with their environment, in particular how cancer cells interact with the tissue surrounding the tumor, also known as the tumor microenvironment. We use a combination of live-cell imaging and other cell biological, biochemical and molecular techniques to examine cell structure, dynamics and function in the context of the living cell. Some cells, such as those of the nervous system, have elaborate three-dimensional shapes that are essential to their specialized activities. We study the microtubule cytoskeleton, a complex network of protein polymers that are essential to establish and maintain cell structure. Microtubules have several functions in the cell: they are mechanical and structural elements; they serve as tracks for long-distance movements of organelles and other cargoes; and they can play a direct role in biochemical signaling cascades. We are investigating how certain sub-populations of microtubules are biochemically specialized for specific cellular functions by a combination of sub-cellular location, post-translational modifications, and interactions with other proteins. We are also investigating the role of the tumor microenvironment in the metastatic progression of cancer cells. Both the cells and the non-cellular elements of the tissue surrounding a tumor can play a significant role in whether or not a tumor cell will become invasive. We are using the tools of cell biology and biochemistry, as well as novel biomimetic materials, to explore the role of abnormal cell-cell interactions and cell-matrix interactions in a breast cancer model system.

    "biography": "Marge McShane is a cognitive scientist, computational linguist and knowledge engineer who develops cognitive models of intelligent agents that can collaborate with people in task-oriented, dialog applications. She is particularly interested in the integration of functionalities that are often treated in isolation, such as physiological simulation, emotion modeling and the many aspects of cognition. One aspect of cognition to which she has devoted particular attention is natural language processing, approached from a cross-linguistic perspective and with the goal of producing machine-tractable descriptions that can support sophisticated conversational agents. McShane was a central contributor to the Boas system, a proof-of-concept system that elicited knowledge about any of the world\u2019s languages from linguistically untrained native speakers. Boas used a mixed-initiative strategy, by which the system guided certain aspects of the knowledge compilation process and the user took the lead in others. Among the key requirements were that the system accommodate descriptions of not only anticipated, but also unanticipated, phenomena; that the descriptions be sufficiently formal to directly provide support to a generic machine translation engine; and that the system be usable by informants without the support of developers. McShane has also worked extensively on cognitive modeling in the medical domain, to support the configuration of intelligent agents playing the roles of virtual patients and tutors in training applications such as the Maryland Virtual Patient system. Guided by the functional needs of such agents, McShane has recently begun to pursue the modeling of \u201cmindreading\u201d (otherwise known as mental model ascription), defined as inferring features of another human or artificial agent that cannot be directly observed, such as that agent's beliefs, plans, goals, intentions, personality traits, mental and emotional states, and knowledge about the world. This capability is an essential functionality of intelligent agents if they are to engage in sophisticated collaborations with people. McShane has authored two books, A Theory of Ellipsis (Oxford University Press, 2005) and An Innovative, Practical Approach to Polish Inflection (Lincom Europa, 2003), and has published extensively in the areas of linguistics, natural language processing, cognitive modeling and knowledge representation.",

The reason is that I like mathematics, and I like to use mathematics to understand the world we live in (i.e., I am an applied mathematician). Here are two specific research topics of current interest: 1) Mechanoreception. This is the study of how a living organism senses and then recognizes mechanical stimuli. The mechanoreceptors that I am presently working on are in the auditory system and in skin. For example, the mechanisms through which skin transduces tactile stimuli from a mechanical to neural signal are not understood. Therefore, the goal of my research is to construct a mathematical model that describes this process. This project involves the study of the nonlinear deformation of skin, the analysis of the dynamics of the tactile receptor, and the study of the nonlinear diffusion associated with the electro-chemical processes in the nerve. 2) Sleep-Wake Cycle. The goal of this research project is to derive, and then analyze, a physiologically based model of the human sleep-wake cycle. The approach is to use the known properties of the neurotransmitters associated with wake and sleep, and the regions of the brain in which they function, to derive the model. This approach also incorporates, or accounts for, the states of sleep (REM and NREM) and the mechanisms that regulate it (homeostatic drive and circadian synchronization).

During his 24 years at Sterling Winthrop, he held various scientific and administrative leadership positions and was also Adjunct Professor of Chemistry at Rensselaer. In 1994, he left Sterling-Winthrop and joined the chemistry faculty at Rensselaer as Professor of Chemistry. During the period 1997-2015, he held the concurrent position of Adjunct Professor in the Department of Neuroscience and Experimental Therapeutics at Albany Medical College. Following his retirement from Rensselaer at the end of 2015, he was appointed to the position of Professor Emeritus. Samidorphan - Discovery of a critical component of FDA-approved LYBALVI: At Rensselaer, Professor Wentland led a NIH-funded research program in medicinal chemistry aimed at identifying novel, long-acting oral medications to treat opioid and cocaine use disorders. This research yielded 22 issued US Patents and in four drugs entering clinical trials, one of which is the highly potent mu opioid receptor antagonist samidorphan. Developed by licensing partner Alkermes plc, LYBALVI (aka, ALKS 3831) is an oral medication combining samidorphan with olanzapine and was approved by the US FDA on June 1, 2021 to treat schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder in adults. Olanzapine is an established antipsychotic agent that can cause significant weight gain. The role of samidorphan is to mitigate olanzapine-associated weight gain.",

    "biography": "Nearly every aspect of neuronal function depends on the accurate transport of membrane proteins to axons or dendrites. Axons conduct electrochemical action potentials and primarily send signals, whereas dendrites primarily receive signals. Because these two domains have distinctly different functions, they each require a specific complement of membrane proteins. These proteins are delivered to their cargo by vesicle transport. Vesicle carriers that contain axonal proteins are transported to the axon; vesicle carriers that contain dendritic proteins are transported to dendrites and excluded from the axon. This phenomenon of directed vesicle movement to dendrites or the axon is referred to as selective transport. Understanding the molecular regulation of vesicle transport is a fundamental problem in neuroscience and cell biology and defects in vesicle transport are thought to underlie the axonal degeneration characteristic of many neurodegenerative diseases. Intracellular carriers are moved by motor proteins that generate locomotive force. One family of motor proteins are kinesins. Our long-term goal is to determine the molecular regulation of kinesin motors and understand how they confer specific transport behaviors to vesicles that move cargoes to axons and dendrites. Our lab uses a variety of cell biological approaches to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie intracellular vesicle transport. Primarily, we utilize live-cell fluorescent microscopy to track and measure individual vesicle carriers as they move inside cells. Our experiments also rely heavily on molecular biology, biochemistry, and tissue culture techniques. Dr. Bentley received his Ph.D. in 2010 in the laboratory of Jesse Hay at the University of Montana and completed a postdoc with Gary Banker at Oregon Health & Science University.

    "biography": "Mary Anne Staniszewski investigates culture, art, and media in relation to political and social perspectives. \"I investigate the way we 'invent' things in our cultures, how concepts and institutions emerge, such as art, exhibitions, and race. Framing such entities historically can reveal how we create not only our cultures, but also our sense of ourselves. This perspective has political implications. By making visible the historical limitations of social conventions and disciplinary discourses, my intention is to demonstrate how cultures can be changed and transformed.\" Staniszewski's major research and writing projects form a \"trilogy\" of interdisciplinary investigations of modern art and culture as articulations of the modern self. Staniszewski is completing a book on the third area of analysis, which deals with issues of race and slavery. The first book, Believing Is Seeing: Creating the Culture of Art (Penguin USA, 1995; Korean version translated as \"This Is Not Art,\" introduction and Translator, Yiso Bahc, Seoul: Hyunsil Cultural Studies, Hyun Sil Moon Hwayonju, 2000 and 2007) frames art as we know it--that is art for art's sake--as an \"invention\" of the modern era and a manifestation of the age of the individual and the liberal, democratic, capitalist state. In the second book, The Power of Display: A History of Exhibition Installations at the Museum of Modern Art (MIT Press, 1998; Korean translation: \"Preface: The Power of Display 2006,\" Translator, Kim Sang-kyu et al., Seoul: designLocus, 2007), installations are analyzed as sites for collective rituals that enhance particular notions of subjecthood--in MoMA's case, a U.S. liberal, democratic, capitalist one. Staniszewski has overseen a number of publications and projects related to the New York City cultural center, Exit Art, which closed in June 2012. She has co-edited with Lauren Rosati the exhibition catalogue, Alternative Histories: New York Art Spaces, 1960-2010 (Exit Art and MIT Press, 2012) and conceived the symposium, Contemporary Slavery, which she organized in collaboration with Exit Art's staff, held on June, 11, 2011 and which was produced in conjunction with Exit Art's 2011 Contemporary Slavery exhibition. Staniszewski was the Director of Exit Art's Curatorial Incubator and was Executive Editor of the curatorial program's catalogue, Signs of Change: Social Movement Cultures 1960s to Now, Editors/Curators, Dara Greenwald and Josh MacPhee (Exit Art and AK Press, 2010).",

In one example of her work, Si helped to develop the Tactical Language Training System, a large-scale (six to twelve scenes each for three languages) award-winning project funded by the U.S. military for rapid language and culture training. The system has been used by thousands of military personnel. \u201cComputer-aided interactive narrative is a new form of media that allows the user to play a role in a story and interact with other characters controlled by an automated system. The user\u2019s choices of actions affect the development of the story,\u201d said Si. Narrative itself is a central part of the human experience. Its power to shape people's minds and affect people's behavior has been recognized throughout recorded history. The support for user interactivity distinguishes interactive narrative from other narrative forms. By allowing the user to interact, the experience is richer and potentially more engaging.

Research on both these topics is on-going at Rensselaer. This includes an analytical evaluation of the relationship between seismic damage (repairs per kilometer of pipe) and ground strain, as well as numerical and centrifuge evaluation of buried pipe subject to abrupt PGD at a fault crossing or the margin of a lateral spread. The 1999 MCEER Monograph by O\u2019Rourke and Liu entitled \u201cResponse of Buried Pipeline Subject to Earthquake Effects\u201dprovide background information and a summary for the topic. An updated Buried Pipeline Monograph is expected early in 2011. Snow Loading on Roofs: * Ground Snow Loads * Drift loads on stepped roofs * Drift loads on gable roofs * Eave icing Snow and Ice Loads on Buildings: Snow loading is a structural design consideration for roofs in most states and the controlling load for at least some structural component in about half the states. Although not a significant load from a structural standpoint ice dams frequently lead to infiltration and costly water damage to interior walls and ceiling surfaces. Research on both issues is ongoing at Rensselaer. Of the many types of snow loads; uniform, sliding snow from a higher roof, etc drifted snow results in higher loads and more potential for structural damage. The Rensselaer water flume is being used to simulate snow drift loading and establish relationships for use in national codes. A guide explaining the ASCE 7-10 snow load provision through design examples and frequently asked questions has been published by ASCE Press.",

He is active with the Center for Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (CEES), Scientific Computation Research Center (SCOREC) and the Inverse Problems Center (IPRPI). Failure of geosystems due to natural or man-made hazards such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, or terrorist attacks may have monumental repercussions, sometimes with dramatic and unanticipated consequences on human life and the country\u2019s economy. Dr. Zeghal\u2019s research focuses on three areas that are central to the national effort to reduce the impact of these hazards: (1) multiscale modeling of geosystems, (2) model validation and calibration, and (3) development of improved optimal design tools. The methodology of evaluating and predicting the performance of geosystems is undergoing a significant paradigm shift. Computational simulations are destined to become more prominent than empirical approaches and will ultimately become the main tool for analysis and design of civil systems. A hierarchy of adaptive and cost-effective computational models capable of accurately predicting the multiscale and multiphysics response of geosystems is being developed. This hierarchy enables a seamless handling of the initiation and evolution of the various response and failure mechanisms of soils under extreme loading conditions. The hierarchical models range from homogenized continuum to discontinuous coarse-particle formulations. A class of innovative system identification and inverse problem tools are being developed to calibrate these models using experimental data ranging from soil sample and centrifuge tests to full-scale and field tests. This new generation of computational procedures is being translated to practice through careful interactions with practitioners (from industry and government laboratories) and the introduction of changes in the educational curricula of our students.",

    "biography": "Following an early career in industry as a Sr. research scientist working in the fields of ultrafast lasers, optical communications, and materials processing, I joined the Center for Ultrafast Optical Sciences (CUOS) to explore light transmission through highly scattering media through light manipulation or wavefront shaping. This newly emerging field of optical wavefront shaping involves the ability to manipulate light fields both spatially and temporally. It has largely been enabled by the availability of spatial light modulators (SLM). SLMs are used to create arbitrarily complex light fields that are now powerful elements of the optics toolbox. An SLM also provides means to manipulate the fundamental constituents of classical light or single photons, which obey the laws of quantum physics. In my research, i will be using these new tools to explore novel ways to address topics where conventional optical techniques are hard to apply, such as the control of light propagation in biological tissues, complex photonic structures, plasmonic systems, and multimode fibers. My research ( https://ngomresearch.com/ ) will also directly address the core problem of entanglement degradation by developing methods to create and manipulate entangled light fields carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) and related structured light fields. The light fields are manipulated using wavefront shaping techniques in waveguide e.g. multimode fibers in order to overcome environment induced destruction of coherence.",

Her most recent book is OD: Naloxone and the Politics of Overdose (MIT Press, 2020). \u201cHow have ideas about drugs and drug addiction changed over time? What do we know about drug addiction, and how do we know it? Why do we have the drug policies that we do?\u201d said Campbell. \u201cWe consider some drugs to cause social problems, and others to solve them. Often we are talking about the same molecules\u2014the differences lie in who uses them and how they do so. My research centers on scientific communities who make knowledge about drugs, and interactions between scientists, treatment providers, policymakers, patient advocates\u2014and drug users themselves.\u201d Campbell also studies the ethics of human subjects research; social movements; and the fruitful convergence between neuroscience and addiction research. She has published two books on gender: Gendering Addiction: The Politics of Drug Treatment in a Neurochemical World with Elizabeth Ettorre (Palgrave, 2011) and her first book, Using Women: Gender, Drug Policy, and Social Justice (Routledge, 2000), which was about how drug-using women figured in drug policy discourse from the 1910s to the 1990s. Campbell and co-authors JP Olsen and Luke Walden published a visual history of the federal drug treatment hospital in Lexington, Kentucky, titled The Narcotic Farm: The Rise and Fall of America\u2019s First Prison for Drug Addicts (Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 2008). Campbell also appeared in Olsen and Walden\u2019s 2007 documentary, The Narcotic Farm, and she often speaks on radio shows about the relevance of this project to current drug treatment. Campbell\u2019s scholarly book on the history of the formative science conducted by the laboratory at The Narcotic Farm, which was called the Addiction Research Center and is now the intramural research program of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, is titled Discovering Addiction: The Science and Politics of Substance Abuse Research (University of Michigan Press, 2007).

    "biography": "In her current art work and multimedia research, Patricia Search designs multimedia installations that explore the aesthetics of space, time, and action in computer interface design. \u201cI work with digital media and create interactive installations that highlight ways to use diverse media, exploration, physical interaction, and social discourse to create immersive experiences for online communication,\u201d Search said. \u201cThese multisensory environments create perceptual dichotomies that juxtapose realism and fantasy, logic and emotion, continuity and transition. The installations incorporate non-Western perspectives of space, time, and action inspired by indigenous cultures, resulting in innovative ways to use interaction design to define a sense of place. As a result, my research is expanding the syntax of experience design and shaping new dimensions in relational aesthetics through the integration of physical and virtual environments. In these installations, multiple viewers use the interaction with physical and virtual elements, social discourse, and memory to define the aesthetics of the experience and a sense of place.\u201d Patricia Search has had 38 solo exhibitions and multimedia installations of her art throughout the United States, including 11 in New York City, as well as exhibitions in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Cyprus, France, Germany and Taiwan. She has also participated in over 150 group exhibitions in the United States, Canada, Australia, France, Italy, Germany, Portugal, the Netherlands, Czech Republic, Greece, China, and Japan. She was awarded a Fellowship in Computer Art from the New York Foundation for the Arts and received a Fulbright Senior Specialists Grant to work on multimedia projects with two universities in Australia. In 2005, she received the Creative Achievement Award from the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA), and in 2010, she was awarded the IVLA James G. Sucy Distinguished Service Award.

Her research intersects the field of Science and Technology Studies (particularly Infrastructure Studies) with research in Disability Studies. She focuses on the development of large technological systems, especially transport infrastructures, and the work undertaken by marginalized communities to mold these networks. Velho\u2019s current book project explores the question of accessibility in public transit. She discusses the process of stabilization of large systems in ways that have become exclusionary for specific demographics that are considered \u201cnon-standard\u201d. These barriers, she argues, have long-term consequences and often develop into a vicious cycle of social exclusion, but can be progressively overcome if marginalized communities are re-engaged in decision-making fora. Velho has also identified the active engagement of disabled people with infrastructures. She examines tactical maneuvers as ways of temporarily re-inscribing access requirements in ways that would often be considered subversive to maintainers of the network. Velho\u2019s research interests are varied and interdisciplinary, including (but not limited to), infrastructure studies; cyborg anthropology/sociology; inclusive design; social exclusion and inclusion processes; standards and classification in governance; Latin American science and technology studies/policy; and disability/ableism studies.

In bacteria, RNA is synthesized through the process of transcription by the multi-subunit enzyme RNA polymerase (RNAP). For proper initiation of transcription, RNAP must temporarily associate with a specificity subunit known as Sigma factor, to recognize a promoter, the site of transcription initiation. Bacteria can contain several Sigma factors, each differentially activated and responsible for regulating specific sets of genes or regulons. The development of Next Generation Sequencing techniques such as ChIP-seq and RNA-seq have allowed us to map the binding of multiple Sigma factors across the bacterial genome and determine, at unprecedented resolution, the regulons for each. Unexpectedly, Sigma factor binding and transcription initiation are pervasive; a large fraction of Sigma binding sites occur inside genes. This is contrary to the \u201ctextbook\u201d view where promoters are located in between genes and a short distance away from the genes that they control. The role(s) of these \u201cnon-canonical\u201d promoters is a mystery, and the next goal is unravel their function on gene expression and the cell lifecycle.",

    "biography": "Professor Gross received his Ph.D. from 'Brooklyn Poly' (Polytechnic University) working on Polymer Stereochemistry (synthetic chemistry) and then performed postdoctoral research with Robert Lenz at UMASS Amherst on the synthesis/properties of polyhydroxyalkanoates (i.e. bacterial polyesters). His research is motivated by the urgent need to develop sustainable chemicals and materials to meet the demands of a rapidly rising global population while mitigating risks of increased green-house gas emissions asociated with climate change. Gross is focusing the groups inventiveness on research that has the potential to revolutionize the way we synthesize next-generation chemicals and materials as well as improve human health. For this purpose, the group is combining the best chemical and biocatalysts to develop efficient green routes to low molar mass molecules, polymers and materials. He is also applying green chemistry principles to develop next-generation therapeutics. For this, we look to nature for tailorable bioactives and use a variety of tools to create matrices for tissue engineering and bioresorbable biomaterials. The result of our emphasis on implementing green chemical principles is the development of synthetic routes that operate under mild reaction conditions (e.g. low temperature, ambient pressure, avoid toxic reagents) that increase worker safety, improve reaction efficiencies (i.e. atom economy) while avoiding protection-deprotection steps. By working this way we increase the chance that we develop will be scalable and used. Examples of ongoing research are as follows. There is a need to develop efficient and scalable methods to synthesize peptides. These building blocks hold great promise for creating antimicrobial, metal binding, self-assembling, bioadhesives (to replace sutures) and environmentally responsive materials. However, peptide synthesis currently relies on solid and liquid phase methods (SPPS and LPPS) that are expensive and, consequently, prohibit the use of peptides in these and other exciting fields of application. Our laboratory is pioneering methods that use protease-catalyst to build peptides in aqueous media without the need for protection-deprotection steps. Protease-catalyzed peptide synthesis allows scale-up of peptide building blocks for a wide range of exciting material applications. In other work, we are using the selectivity of lipase catalysts to synthesize functional bioresorable polyesters that meet important needs for tissue engineering matrices, drug delivery systems and bioactive materials. Another focus area is the use of bacteria that directly extrude cellulose nanofibers from cell membranes that become intertwined creating interconnected nanofiberous 3-D matrices. One aim in this program is to control matrix parameters including fiber size and porosity to tailor bacterial cellulose for applications as membranes for separation/water purification, reservoirs for liquid crystals that form voltage regulated switchable windows and much more. Also, our laboratory is looking to nature for next-generation bioactive compounds (e.g. anticancer, antimicrobial, immunomodulators, insecticides and tick repellents). This work makes use of a family of surface active microbial synthesized glycolipids that can be molecularly engineered to enhance their physical and biological properties. In addition, we are using essential oils and their components as potent/renewable/safe pesticides, insecticides and tick repellents. Some of these antimicrobial components are finding their way into a new family of adherent films that protect fruits and vegetables from premature spoilage. Emulsion and encapsulation technologies are being used to effectively apply or deliver these natural bioactives. Another group project is motivated by the problem of plastic pollution. It is now evident that seperating plastic wastes and physical recycling of recovered plastics has largely failed to create effective pathways for plastic re-use. While our group is interested in the overall potential of biorecycling, work thus far has focused on a family of enzymes known as cutinases that actually degrade plastic water bottles made from PET to their constituent building blocks (terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol). Our ability to engage in this large array of project areas is possible due to our belief that thet best work is done through productive collaborations with scientists and engineers that bring new perspectives and expertise. Consequently, we have developed productive long-term collaborations with physicists, biologists, biomedical engineers, entomologists, mechanical engineers and process engineers. Gross has about 500 publications in peer-reviewed journals that have been cited over 26,000 times (h-index 82, i10-index 362). He has graduated over 40 Ph.D. students who are enjoying successful carreers in industry and acedmics. In addition, he believes in the formula of having Ph.D. students active in mentoring as well as working in teams with undergraduate and high school students.",

As a result, there are significant variations in microbial communities, redox conditions and methane dynamics. Results from this work can be used to improve and inform climate models.

    "biography": "Cells utilize dynamic biopolymer networks to carry out mechanical tasks during diverse processes such as cell division, migration, and development. Disruptions in the integrity of these networks have been linked to disease, and chemical compounds (e.g. taxol, the vinca alkaloids) that target biopolymers such as microtubules have been used extensively as therapeutics in the treatment of cancer. Single molecule biophysical studies of proteins and DNA have yielded insights into the function of individual components required for these processes. However, intracellular networks are organized on the micron-scale by the collective action of ensembles of dozens of such proteins. It is currently unclear how long-range mechanical cues are transmitted or how diverse nanometer-scale \u2018building blocks\u2019 are organized within the micron-scale structures that do work in cells. The Forth lab combines biophysical techniques, such as optical trapping and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, to understand how forces are transmitted across these networks. By reconstituting functionally active microtubule networks out of purified components and monitoring how the system behaves under biologically relevant mechanical constraints, we seek to elucidate the mechanisms that drive successful cell division. Dr. Forth received his Ph.D. in physics from Cornell University in 2009, where his doctoral work involved designing next-generation optical trapping instruments and monitoring the response of DNA to twisting and stretching. Dr. Forth then pursued post-doctoral research in the Laboratory of Chemistry and Cell Biology at the Rockefeller University in New York City, where he focused on applying biophysical methods to the study of microtubule networks that are used by cells during cell division.

    "biography": "Skye Anicca is a Lecturer of Literature and Creative Writing with specializations in multi-ethnic U.S. literature and fiction writing. She works at the intersections of narrative craft, literary criticism, and cultural studies. Her scholarship situates contemporary American fiction in a transnational context that draws on feminist and postcolonial studies, and her creative work focuses on experimentation with narrative time and structure. Her teaching and research interests include creative writing studies, new immigrant literature, border studies, Latinx and Caribbean literature, U.S. pop culture and media, fairy tales, and women\u2019s literature. Her instructional methodologies include service learning, team-based learning, and experiential education. She recently completed a collection of short stories set in the 1990s and centered around rites of passage for women and girls in an emergent global America. The stories are connected through interrogations of normalcy, gender, class, race, nation, and narrative within the cultural and political milieu of the late twentieth century. Her newest creative project is a novel set on the Texas U.S./Mexico border, and she is also at work on a critical project that suggests new markers of the bildungsroman informed by studies in multi-ethnic U.S. literature and border theory. Dr. Anicca\u2019s interest in the rhetoric of myth and fairy tales as a means of interrogating enduring, transcultural narrative frameworks threads through her critical and creative work. Her article in The Journal of Narrative Theory entitled \u201cCripping the Mermaid: A Borderlands Approach to Feminist Disability Studies in Valerie Martin\u2019s \u2018Sea Lovers\u2019\u201d argues for a reclamation of the mermaid figure through a feminist disability studies lens mediated by border theory. Her short story \u201cThe Sleeping Girl\u201d explores the effects of hyper mobile narratives and bodies across borders. This work won Fairy Tale Review\u2019s 2018 Prose Award, selected by Kathryn Davis.

Most of what I do academically falls within the realm of Geophysics. Geophysical observations and data analysis techniques are the most effective tools for determining what lies beneath the surface of the Earth. They can be applied at a spectrum of scales, from a few meters to thousands of kilometers, to address a variety of objectives from the detection of salt water invading an aquifer to fundamental questions about how the Earth works. My primary interests in both teaching and research center on the development and application of these geophysical techniques. We have ongoing research projects in a number of fields pertaining to geophysical data analysis and a substantial inventory of equipment for graduate and undergraduate use. We offer courses in field methods that include instruction in both the theory of geophysical data analysis and the application of this theory to problems in the real world. One of these courses is devoted primarily to the evaluation of groundwater problems such as the contamination of aquifers and the identification of buried channels. Others address larger scale problems such as the formation of basins in the western United States and the large mountain belts of central Asia. Among the techniques that we learn about and apply are potential field methods (gravity and magnetics), electrical methods (resistivity and electromagnetism) and seismologic methods (using both controlled sources and earthquakes) and modern surveying techniques using the Global Positioning System. Students are encouraged to become involved in the actual collection, reduction and interpretation of geophysical data. Over the past few years both undergraduate and graduate students have been involved in research projects directed at understanding collisional processes in Taiwan, the Pakistan Himalayas and the Tien Shan, in determining the motion of the Philippine Sea plate, in understanding the evolution of the Basin and Range, and the details of earthquake processes in California. They also have been involved in projects to map underground water channels in upstate New York, waste site evaluations and investigations for evidence of recent seismic activity on the borders of the Adirondacks.",

She has taught courses in Biomedical Ethics, Research Ethics, Philosophy of Human Nature and Science, Technology and Human Values. Teaching has been a passion for her since she received her undergraduate degree in Education from the University of Windsor. Her main objective as a Philosophy instructor is to develop the critical thinking skills of her students. Dr. Smith encourages students to critically examine their own beliefs and to attempt to create rational defenses for those beliefs. Along with the development of critical thinking skills, she focuses upon the development of writing skills and learning the philosophical content of the particular area of philosophy relevant to a course.

He also served as Associate Dean for Research and Graduate Programs in the School of Engineering from 2011 to 2015. He earned his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from RPI in 1994 and 1997, respectively. Dr. Abdoun's primary research interests are centrifuge modeling, soil-structure interaction, soil remediation, field advanced sensing, and data visualization. He has conducted, and/or advised other researchers on several hundreds of successful high-quality centrifuge model tests conducted at the RPI centrifuge. The centrifuge experiments, supplemented by high-quality reliable measurements, have been used to develop or calibrate new design or retrofit engineering methods. Professor Abdoun led Rensselaer's physical modelling research team that clarified the failure mechanisms of some of the New Orleans levees during Hurricane Katrina, providing critical feedback to the corresponding numerical analyses. He worked closely on this with the US Army Corps of Engineers and the corresponding US National Academies Oversight Committee, and his work was shown on national networks (CNN, NBC, Discovery, ASCE News, Times, etc.) and cited in great detail in an article evaluating the lessons from Hurricane Katrina in the Spring 2007 issue of The Bridge, published by the National Academy of Engineering. Professor Abdoun designed & developed this novel wireless shape-acceleration sensor array, taking advantage of new advances in fiber optic and MEMS sensor technologies. The sensors are capable of measuring ground acceleration and permanent deformation to a depth of about 15 m, at a cost 1/10th or 1/20th of existing inclinometer and borehole technologies. In situ 3D ground deformation and 2D soil acceleration are measured at close intervals. Each sensor array is connected to a wireless sensor node to enable real time monitoring and informed assessment of pending failure. He is a member of several technical committees and the editorial board of technical journals, including ASCE Geo Institute Committee for Earthquake Engineering and Soil Dynamics, ASCE Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering, Canadian Journal, etc. Dr. Abdoun is the recipient of Rensselaer's 2004, 2006, & 2007 School of Engineering Excellence in Research & Teaching Award, and the 2004 prestigious Casimir Gzowski awarded by the Canadian Society for Civil Engineering.

Student Projects : NanoTEC lab offers opportunities for a variety of hands-on, experimental, manufacturing, and simulation & design projects for graduate and undergraduate students. Email project inquiries to borcat@rpi.edu . As of 2019 Dr. T. Borca-Tasciuc graduated (as main advisor or co-advisor) 19 PhD students and 30 Master students. He authored >90 journal articles, has >5800 citations, and h-index of 38. Research (examples) Research focuses on experimental investigations in synergy with simulations and materials structure. Key features in investigated samples (thin films, nanoparticles, nanowires, or the nano-domains in nanomaterials) are typically smaller than characteristic length scales of the heat carriers (such as the carrier mean free path), so conduction of heat can strongly deviate from the classical Fourier law. Similarly, nanoscale heat sources could also exhibit non-classical conduction of heat. Non-Fourier heat conduction has critical implications for the thermal management of nanodevices, nanointerconnects, optoelectronics, or the design of nanocomposites and nanomaterials. On another hand, nanostructures and nanostructured materials enable novel ways to independently control the thermoelectric properties (Seebeck coefficient and electrical and thermal conductivities) that define the thermoelectric figure of merit Z, a metric important for thermoelectric energy conversion applications (such as solid state refrigeration and power generation). The enhancement of Z in nanostructures is mainly effected through control of size, interfaces, and doping in the material. The goal is to obtain non-dimensional figures of merit (ZT, T is temperature) that increase to values as high as 1.5-3, from the current values <1, to revolutionize solid state thermoelectric applications for cooling and power generation from waste heat. Understanding and engineering the thermal and thermoelectric transport at nanoscale is therefore an essential and challenging part of Dr. T. Borca-Tasciuc\u2019s research. A critical role is played by development of experimental techniques able to probe transport properties at nanoscale, in nanomaterials, across-nanointerfaces, or to test the operation of nanoscale electronic, optoelectronic, and thermoelectric devices. These techniques are employed to perform studies of property-structure relationship to understand and optimize thermal and thermoelectric transport as required by specific applications. Selected examples of techniques developed include: 1) a scanning thermal microprobe for quantitative characterization of the thermal conductivity and Seebeck coefficient with microscale resolution; 2) a transient method for measurement of all thermoelectric properties as well as electrical and thermal contact resistances in films; 3) a photothermoelectric method to determine the anisotropic thermal conductivity and the interface thermal resistance in thin film on-substrate systems; 4) a Joule heating thermometry method for characterization of thermal transport from nanoscale heat sources. Selected investigations include: 1) discovery of a new class of highly scalable, high figure of merit, nanostructured bulk thermoelectric materials (patent); 2) implementation of a novel mechanism for formation of high thermal conductivity networks in polymer composites filled with nanoparticles (patent); 3)investigations of anisotropic thermal properties in aligned carbon nanotube arrays and aligned carbon-nanotube polymer composites; 4) studies of the interface thermal resistance at the native interface between carbon nanotube arrays and the silicon substrate; 5) investigations of thermal transport in Si/Ge and Si/SiC multilayers; 6) investigations of non-Fourier thermal transport from individual nanoscale heaters to silicon substrate.",

He has directed research sponsored by IARPA, DARPA, ARL, AFRL, NSF, the European Commission, NSERC, as well as a number of industry-funded projects. He was involved in IBM\u2019s Jeopardy! Challenge in advanced question answering. Dr. Strzalkowski has published over a hundred and fifty scientific papers, and is the editor of several books, including Advances in Open Domain Question Answering . He serves on the Editorial Board of the journal of Natural Language Engineering . Prior to joining RPI, Dr. Strzalkowski was Professor of Computer Science at SUNY Albany. At SUNY, he was the founding Director of the Institute for Informatics, Logics, and Security Studies with research budget of more than $35 million. He came to SUNY from GE CRD where he was a Natural Language Group Leader and Principal Scientist. At GE, Dr. Strzalkowski directed projects on automated technical manuals, medical informatics, speech recognition, automated summarization, as well as multimedia processing including language and video. Before coming to GE, he was a research faculty at the Courant Institute of New York University, where he worked on applications of natural language processing to information retrieval. Current projects include research into social dimensions of information spread online, internet ethnography, and building effective AI defenses against disinformation and exploitation of human socio-cognitive vulnerabilities online, including social engineering attacks. Some example projects include: GATOR: The Goal-oriented Autonomous Dialogue System. We develop a new type of human-machine dialogue system that uses deep learning technologies (such as transformers) to learn how to recognize and generate dialogue plans, i.e., semantic and pragmatic structures that represent one party\u2019s goals and intentions, as well as the impact these are having on the other party. Unlike the current transformer-driven chatbots, the core learning is not to transform one language expression (input) into another language expression (response) but instead to construct a response plan that would properly address the plan in the input and the history of interaction. Consequently, the learning process takes three types of information: (1) the input utterance; (2) its semantic-pragmatic plan, i.e., the plan that was used to produce the utterance, and (3) the history of interaction up to this point. Furthermore, the cumulative history of the dialogue is not merely the memory of the utterances exchanged earlier, but it captures, in a condensed semantic form, the evolving state of the parties\u2019 objectives as well as the emerging sociolinguistic behavioral patterns of both (all) parties. Personalized AutoNomous Agents Countering Social Engineering Attacks (PANACEA) protects online users against current and future forms of social engineering. PANACEA serves as an intermediary between attackers (human, automated, hybrid, coordinated) and the potential victim(s) they target. Depending upon the nature and source of communication, PANACEA either handles it autonomously, or allows the user to proceed with an exchange while monitoring the conversation and intervening as needed by (1) inserting or modifying users\u2019 messages, (2) instructing the user how best to respond, while at the same time (3) initiating an investigation to identify the attacker. (DARPA ASED Program) COMETH (Computational Ethnography from Metaphors and Polarized Language). The objective of this project is to develop a methodology and accompanying software tools for constructing dynamic socio-behavioral models of communities based on online content that their members produce. A community can be defined by the set of salient concepts that its members recognize, along with the values they assign to them. The resulting causal models are then applied to derive culturally biased interpretations of novel information by prototyping the process by which such new information is adapted to fit into the community current model. (DARPA UGB) Social Convos: A New Approach to Modeling Information Diffusion in Social Media. In this project, we recast our understanding of all social media as a landscape of collectives, or \u201cconvos\u201d: sets of users connected by a common interest in an (possibly evolving) information artifact, such as a repository in GitHub, a subreddit in Reddit or a group of hashtags in Twitter. Convos are represented by the collections of features that capture their internal social dynamics. Furthermore, convos are basis for modeling large and small internet-based communities as \u201chybrid organisms\u201d that interact in various ways with one another and react collectively to external stimuli, including information and disinformation campaigns.

    "biography": "W. Randolph Franklin develops and implements fast parallel algorithms on very large geometric datasets in CAD and GIS. He's also modeled and processed large terrain databases, e.g., to compress, to compute hydrography and visibility, and to site observers, and compressed 5D environmental data sets. The algorithms are the fastest in their class. His current research hobby is designing and implementing small, simple, and fast data structures and algorithms for large geometric datasets. Note that efficiency in both space and time can become more important as machines get faster. This research is applicable to computational cartography, computer graphics, computational geometry, and geographic information science. He is now currently studying parallel CAD operations, such as overlaying 3D triangulations (tetrahedrulations). 3D-EPUG-Overlay is an algorithm for exactly computing the intersection (it can also compute general overlays) of pairs of 3D triangulated meshes. Each input mesh may represent a single solid or a more complex polygonal subdivision (representing multiple solids, each one identified by a label). 3D-EPUG-Overlay employs a combination of several techniques to ensure its correctness and efficiency. His last major NSF research project was to understand the mathematics of terrain. Another recent NSF project, together with Cutler and Zimmie, was analyzing how levees erode when overtopped, and testing models in a geotechnical centrifuge. Subprojects include compressing terrain while preserving slope, compressing multidimensional environmental data, and extending partial hydrological data to a complete and consistent river network. Another major project compressed and operated on terrain for DARPA/DSO/GeoStar. The operations included multiple observer siting and path planning. His longterm uneachable goal is to establish terrain modeling on a proper formal foundation that respects its physical properties.

    "biography": "As an industrial researcher, Wesley Turner has had a varied career with varying focus depending on the needs of the research communities and industries to which he has belonged. This is reflected in the varying types of research in which he has been engaged. Some examples of researc initiatives are included below. Computational Linear Algebra: Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is a powerful method for modeling the behavior of dynamic systems and processes. Most finite element formulations require the solution of linear systems of equations either as a direct result of a discretization process, or as part of the iterative solution to a nonlinear discretization. These linear systems are generally sparse and often symmetric positive definite (SPD). While efficient solution processes are well understood for many formulations, particularly where the condition number of the system matrix is well behaved, systems which are exceedingly large, or that deviate from SPD can exhibit rapid growth in the condition number making the system solution much more difficult. In this research, Wesley Turner investigated the efficient solution of large, sparse, non-symmetric systems with the goal of effectively limiting the growth of the condition number via a preconditioning operation. The preconditioner was derived based on a hierarchical (spatial) decomposition of the physical space of the FEA analysis. Both the preconditioner and the underlying solution methods were designed for parallel implementation on a large distributed memory computer. Forensic Facial Reconstruction: Reconstruction of the facial features of an individual based on the skull in isolation is an important part of archaeological and criminal investigation. The historic manner of reconstruction relies on sparse flesh depth measurements. Clay is placed on a model of the skull to match a prescribed flesh depth at a few measurement points and is then \u201cartistically\u201d smoothed to interpolate the face between the sparse depth markers. In this research Wesley Turner was part of a team who used medical imaging to precisely characterize the facial flesh depth densely across populations of individuals. This data was used to generate a statistical model for variation that could be adapted to a given skull in isolation resulting in both an average, i.e. likely, face for a given skull as well as the modes of variation that could be anticipated. His primary contributions to this research were in the deformable registration of the skulls to a single representative exemplar and in the generation and visualization of the reconstruction to include visualization of the modes of variation. Cancer Detection and Characterization: Despite decades of research by the medical and scientific communities, cancer remains a serious health issue. Early detection is critical to patient prognosis. Fortunately, advances in medical imaging are giving us increasing opportunities to find lesions while they are small enough to be treated effectively. These advances, however, are not without a cost. Detecting small lesions requires increased imaging resolution resulting in larger image sizes and more images for review. In this research, Dr. Turner was involved in reducing radiologist workload and improving detection and lesion characterization via automated analysis of the medical images. This work has spanned multiple imaging modalities (CT, MRI, OCT, etc.) and multiple lesion types (lung, brain, breast, etc.), but all of the research can be broadly classified as detection and characterization. In that context, his role has been to develop and apply mathematical models and imaging heuristics to medical images in order to differentiate lesions form normal anatomy and to measure lesion features. Manufacturing Processes and Inspection: As in the medical world, automatic or computer-aided detection of anomalies in manufactured parts can result in increased safety and lower costs. Simulating operations on manufactured parts and performing inspections is critical. While this is a broad area, Wesley Turner's major contributions to this research were (1) the generation of a virtual environment mocking up a part inspection cell so that inspection could be performed efficiently; (2) providing registration mechanisms to align the inspected part to a CAD model, to align detected anomalies to their precise location on a manufactured part, and to precisely align scan cell components to the virtual environment; and (3) generating reproducible and robust plans for automatic scan procedures. Big Data Initiatives in Healthcare: Increasingly, data is becoming commonplace, but access to data and getting the analysis capability into the hands of domain researchers such as biologists, doctors or other healthcare workers, geneticists, and etc. is becoming the true bottleneck. In this research, Dr. Turner explored the twin topics of ease of use and semantic interchange. His primary outputs were a system (Visomics) that coupled data aggregation and algorithm development with a mechanism for efficient use by domain experts using tools familiar to them; and a system architecture document describing a patient-centric protocol for secure and semantically valid exchange",

He was awarded a tenured associate professorship in 1995. Le Coz has been a visiting faculty member at LSI Logic Corporation and at Sandia National Laboratories. He has been named a Digital Equipment Corporation Fellow, a General Motors Scholar, and a Connecticut State Scholar, and has received awards from the American Cyanamid Company and PerkinElmer, Inc. Le Coz is a member of Tau Beta Pi, Eta Kappa Nu, Sigma Xi, and the American Physical Society. Le Coz's research interests include transport in semiconductor devices, equilibrium heterojunction theory, and random-walk algorithms for the physical design of ICs. His research team is focusing on inventing and developing novel, stochastic RW algorithms for solving electro- and magneto-static, electrodynamic, and thermal equations in massively coupled electrical and optical IC-interconnect structures. A principal goal of his research is to maintain full parallelism, which will provide the efficient computational enhancement needed to meet future modeling and simulation requirements in high-end digital ICs. Team members are currently working on RW impulse-response extraction algorithms. They are developing novel impulse-response, moment-extraction algorithms for both lumped-element and continuum-domain descriptions of IC interconnects. Their approach involves diagrammatic expansion of a perturbation series (similar to that employed by R.P. Feynman in theoretical physics) and subsequent stochastic RW evaluation. Another area of Le Coz's research is heat-equation solution in complex, IC-interconnect structures. The desire to improve IC integration density has generated significant interest in 3D (stacked-chip) configurations. In fact, thermal management within 3D chips appears to present a serious technological challenge. A related problem is the development of efficient algorithms and methodologies for numerical analysis of heat transport within these complex conductor-dielectric interconnect structures. Le Coz's team is developing a multi-scale, thermal-analysis methodology for 3D chip configurations. Their methodology relies on a global-local, floating-RW method for solving the heat equation in complex material structures. Le Coz's studies support three tasks of the Interconnect Focus Center (IFC): Circuit & System Design and Modeling, Novel Communication Mechanisms, and Materials and Processing.

    "biography": "Zbigniew Oksiuta is an artist, architect and scientist experimenting with the possibility of designing biological structures. His work combines architecture, biology, physics and genetic engineering. Oksiuta concentrates on reducing his research of space to the very necessary minimum: to the physical existence based primarily upon the verifiable physical and chemical parameters putting aside historical, social, urbanistic and aesthetic factors. His projects such as \"Spatium Gelatum\" and \"Breading Space\" and \"Space Garden\" examine new soft technologies and biological materials which enable the development of new kind of living habitat in the biosphere and in space",
