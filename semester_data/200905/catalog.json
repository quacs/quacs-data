The interdependence among building materials, acoustic qualities, enclosure systems, interior, finish, and other systems is investigated, with an emphasis on the broader architectural design endeavor. Drawing as a means of understanding forms the basis for a semester-long project to be done in small groups. Case studies will center on concepts and systems that have not yet found their way into mainstream practice. The course approach will involve in-class presentations, project work, field trips and case studies. WebCT will be used to expand the student\u2019s access to course materials and allow for a measure of distance learning. Sustainability: The notion that design intentions can be nullified through incorrect construction is stressed. The importance of proper detailing, construction, and maintenance to accomplish lasting and efficient enclosures is highlighted. Skills to diagnose and treat incorrect construction are developed."

The point is to help uncover some of the self-evidently \u201ctrue\u201d presuppositions that we all make when we design. By knowing what we take for granted and knowing also that others work with presuppositions which may be substantively different from our own, we begin to realize both our ability to exercise choices and our responsibility to think through the consequences of those choices. Each of the approaches is explored as to its ontological, epistemological, value, and methodological presuppositions. Two very direct questions help in this reflection: What relation does the given approach have to the formative conditions of the contemporary city? and, How does each of the design approaches relate to the American experiences in thought and action?"

The structural makeup of metals, ceramics, polymers, and composite materials is discovered and their resulting properties, costs, and life cycle consequences are clarified. An understanding of basic mechanical properties is established hands on by conducting tension, compression, and 3 point bending tests (mse-lab). Physical performance of material constructs as synergy between form and material properties is further illustrated. Experiments are conducted that introduce such major concepts as structural loading, properties of sections, and resulting system performance. Sustainability: The concept of life cycles is introduced; material and energy flows are tracked throughout the entire material life cycle. This will be accomplished alongside introducing major material groupings (metals, polymers, ceramics, and composites). Students come to realize that environmental concerns are directly related to structural composition and material availability. Consequences of resource extraction, distribution, manipulation, use, and disposal, reuse or recycle are addressed at both local and global scales. Selected field trips to materials extraction, processing, manufacturing, disposal, and recycling facilities are aimed to give physical meaning to the concept of life cycle."

    "description": "Introduction to Structures introduces the student of Architecture to the principles of structural mechanics and their application to basic architectural structures comprised primarily of wood. The fundamentals of statics are presented in order to gain an understanding of the way in which external forces produce internal stresses in individual members and, in essence, flow through the building system to be resolved at the foundation level. The principles of strength of materials are studied to understand how particular structural materials and configurations manage to resist these forces without unacceptable distortions, or even failure. Wood structural properties are studied in all their complexity as a means to internalize the more theoretical topics broached. Through in-class presentations, reading, homework and project work, computer lab, field trips, and case studies the student will be aided in developing this intuitive (while practical) understanding. It is recognized that intuitions of building technologies are not acquired quickly but result from much study, observation, and practice. Introduction to Structures makes use of the several approaches above to ensure that the beginning student is provided with a broad, solid base for future structural investigations. WebCT will be used to expand the student\u2019s access to course materials and allow for a measure of distance learning. Sustainability: The following notions are introduced as important attributes of sustainable structures and construction: durability and service life, and life cycle cost."

The theoretical concepts covered in the introduction course form the conceptual basis for work in Structures 2, with relevant new concepts/techniques covered. Innovative, non-normative structural systems are investigated and discussed. Analysis and design will proceed using primarily computer-aided techniques. The course approach will involve in-class presentations, homework and project work, computer lab, field trips, and case studies. WebCT will be used to expand the student\u2019s access to course materials and allow for a measure of distance learning. Sustainability: The following notions are introduced as important attributes of sustainable structures and construction: structural robustness, and programmatic flexibility. (Design optimization approaches are introduced and explored as avenues to accomplish more optimum design conditions under increasingly strict design constraints.)"
