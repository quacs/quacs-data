        "description": "Creative applications of generative artificial intelligence have exploded in the past year, including image generation tools like Stable Diffusion and DALLE-2 and text generation tools like Chat-GPT3.  This course will survey the theoretical foundations of these tools, focusing on generative models and self-supervised learning, as well as explore the historical and ethical considerations involving the procedural generation of art.  Students will apply cutting-edge tools for generating creative content and critique each otherâ€™s work."

        "name": "Non-Classical Logic",
        "description": "This course provides an introduction to the philosophical and formal aspects of several families of non-classical logics that provide alternatives to classical (Russell-Frege) logic. Emphases will include philosophical objections to particular components of classical logic and how alternative formalizations of reasoning have emerged in order to accommodate these objections. In particular, topics to be covered will include logics of strict implication, intuitionistic logic, relevant logic, and fuzzy logic."
