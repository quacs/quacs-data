In the 20th century, the movements of Cubism, Futurism, Neo-Plasticism, Constructivism, Purism, Surrealism, and Dadaism consisted of dynamic dialogs between architecture and painting. These exchanges allowed each to have a profound and deep impact upon the other. By contrast, in early 21st century, there seems to be all but a mute relationship between the two. This course intends to help break that silence. This course will begin to bridge the divide by establishing new connections between the current preoccupations with materials, procedures, and affects that are emerging in both contemporary painting and architecture. Twisted Siblings seeks to explore and discover new relationships between the most cutting-edge digital technologies and how painting may influence the expressive capacities of these technologies. As contemporary painting and architecture seek to establish future directions, a new dialog and exchange of ideas should be emerging, to ensure a dynamic and radical future for both. The course will consist of a series of lectures, discussions, and presentations. Students will be expected to research a number of individual architects, painters, and writers who are producing work of related interest. Students will be responsible for completing a research project, which synthesizes the content of the course.",

Students will explore load transfer in different structural assemblies and consider how seismic and other complex loading can impact architectural considerations. Innovative, non-normative structural systems are investigated and discussed. Design optimization approaches are introduced and explored as avenues to accomplish more optimum design conditions under increasingly strict design constraints.",

It is hoped that the knowledge gained in the RD Seminar will assist students in the development of their own individual thesis proposals while they contribute to active research. B.Arch. students can only register for the 4000 level of this course and M.Arch. students must register only for the 6000 level of this course.",

The course will examine the ISO standards of room-acoustic measurements, develop students' research goals and a specific set of data to gather for their research. The course will also prepare the students with the fundamental knowledge on CATT Acoustic and/or EASE in geometrical modeling. Then the students and professors will visit a number of performance venues (e.g. EMPAC Concert Hall, and/ or other venues) and perform the room-acoustic measurements. Students will then work on analyzing and interpreting the research results. Practice measurements will be scheduled in the gallery or somewhere on campus before trips to performance halls. MATLAB will play a central role throughout all the classes (SRL I & II) and the thesis research projects. It will be used during the class exercises.

No prior experience with improvisation is required, and participants from any musical background, including electronic and computer music, are encouraged to join.

The course focuses students, early in the year, on attaining knowledge and proficiency in several critical areas they will need to operate effectively as Army officers. These areas include: Coordinate Activities with Staffs, Counseling Theory and Practice within the \u201cArmy Context,\u201d Training Management, and Ethics. While proficiency attained in each of these areas will initially be at the apprentice level, students will continue to sharpen these skills as they perform their roles as cadet officers within the ROTC program and after commissioning. At the end of the course, students should possess the fundamental skills, attributes, and abilities to operate as competent leaders.",

As a follow-up to the ethics instruction in USAR 4010, the course starts with a foundation in the legal aspects of decision making and leadership. The curriculum reinforces previous instruction on the organization of the Army and introduces how the Army organizes for operations from the tactical to the strategic level. This is followed by instruction on administrative and logistical management that will focus on the fundamentals of soldier and unit level support. At the core of the semester is the Advanced Course Capstone Exercise. This 12-lesson exercise incorporates learning objectives from the entire military science curriculum. The capstone exercise will require students, both individually and collectively, to apply their knowledge to solve problems and confront situations commonly faced by junior officers. Upon completion of the course, students will be prepared for the responsibility of being a commissioned officer in the United States Army.",

Topics include theories of rationality, psychological perspectives on market behavior, and the cognitive underpinnings of economic decision-making. The course also introduces dynamic systems including market, sub-economic, economic externality, and inequality dynamics. These systems are grounded in psychological concepts such as intentional charge, cognitive fields, consciousness, impulse control, and Freudian personality theory.",
