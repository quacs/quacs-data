However, the vulnerabilities and privacy risks of ML models could put public safety and user privacy in danger. Existing studies have shown that the ML applications such as financial analytics and autonomous vehicles are vulnerable to attacks that can manipulate the models to their malicious ends. This course will introduce potential vulnerabilities of ML models, recent research and future directions about the security and privacy problems in real-world machine learning systems. We will cover different types of attacks against computer systems leveraging ML as well as defense techniques, privacy-preserving ML, and robustness and fairness in ML. Students will familiarize themselves with the emerging body of literature on each topic, understand different algorithms, analyze security vulnerabilities, and develop the ability to conduct research projects on related topics.",

Overall, students are required to work on and contribute to open source projects, in particular through multiple commits (commit early, commit often), maintaining a blog, presenting their work and/or specific technical talks, mentoring other projects, etc. This project-based \"course\" may be taken multiple semesters, with grades based on clear effort and contributions rather than a project that meets all of its requirements.",
