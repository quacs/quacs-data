    "description": "RCOS (Rensselaer Center for Open Source) is an eclectic group of undergraduate students that embark on individual and team-based open source projects, primarily software, but also open hardware projects. Many new projects are introduced each semester, though many ongoing and \"higher-profile\" projects are also undertaken. Overall, students are required to work on and contribute to open source projects, in particular through multiple commits (commit early, commit often), maintaining a blog, presenting their work and/or specific technical talks, mentoring other projects, etc. This project-based \"course\" may be taken multiple semesters, with grades based on clear effort and contributions rather than a project that meets all of its requirements.",

    "description": "Networks are everywhere. This course is an interdisciplinary introduction to the emerging science of complex networks and their applications. Topics to be covered include the mathematics of networks, data analysis, network visualization, and applications to ecology, biology, sociology, technology, and other fields. Students will learn about the ongoing research in the field, and ultimately apply their knowledge to conduct their own analysis of a real network data set of their choosing as part of the final project.",

    "description": "Machine learning (ML) has demonstrated superior performance in many areas and has increasingly been deployed in real-world critical applications. However, the vulnerabilities and privacy risks of ML models could put public safety and user privacy in danger. Existing studies have shown that the ML applications such as financial analytics and autonomous vehicles are vulnerable to attacks that can manipulate the models to their malicious ends. This course will introduce potential vulnerabilities of ML models, recent research and future directions about the security and privacy problems in real-world machine learning systems. We will cover different types of attacks against computer systems leveraging ML as well as defense techniques, privacy-preserving ML, and robustness and fairness in ML. Students will familiarize themselves with the emerging body of literature on each topic, understand different algorithms, analyze security vulnerabilities, and develop the ability to conduct research projects on related topics.",

A primary focus of the course is to identify the disruptors in the two technologies from a research lens. Specifically, we intend to discuss how leveraging blockchain technology can benefit AI and how applying AI can enhance the capabilities of blockchain technology. Furthermore, students are encouraged to think about the impact of these two technologies on society. Topics discussed in the course include blockchain fundamentals, smart contracts, web3, federated machine learning, and decentralized applications that combine AI and blockchain technologies.",

In the first half of the course, we will discuss some of the safety vulnerabilities of machine learning models, such as neural network robustness issues, and go over methods to alleviate these issues. In the second half, we will cover concepts from dynamical/autonomous system analysis and verification, once again with a focus on applying machine learning techniques and analyzing their safety. Students will get exposure to adversarial learning and reinforcement learning techniques, as well as to a number of neural network verification tools such as Reluplex, Verisig and others.",
