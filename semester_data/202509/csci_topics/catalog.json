RCOS is a project-based course in which students join a project team and work primarily on one open-source project throughout the semester. Projects must be open source but can be existing external projects, internal (RCOS) projects, or new endeavors. Collaborative and cross-disciplinary projects are encouraged. Students are required to consistently contribute to their open source projects, in particular through multiple commits (commit early, commit often), presenting their work and/or specific technical talks, mentoring other projects, and generally contributing to the open source community.",

We will cover how algorithm design helps tackle major challenges in modern machine learning. You will learn the principles behind learning with efficiency to process very large datasets and techniques for learning from noisy, unreliable data. We will also explore how machine learning is facilitating algorithm design. We will examine how concepts originated from data science, e.g., differential privacy, are being integrated into general algorithms. We will also see how machine learning models can be used to dramatically boost the performance of algorithms. This is a rigorous, proof-based course focused on algorithm design. A solid foundation in algorithms, data structures, and mathematical maturity is required. Expect to spend most of your time with math and proofs in this course.",
