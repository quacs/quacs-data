    "description": "RCOS (Rensselaer Center for Open Source) is an eclectic group of undergraduate students that embark on individual and team-based open source projects, primarily software, but also open hardware projects. Many new projects are introduced each semester, though many ongoing and \"higher-profile\" projects are also undertaken. Overall, students are required to work on and contribute to open source projects, in particular through multiple commits (commit early, commit often), maintaining a blog, presenting their work and/or specific technical talks, mentoring other projects, etc. This project-based \"course\" may be taken multiple semesters, with grades based on clear effort and contributions rather than a project that meets all of its requirements.",
