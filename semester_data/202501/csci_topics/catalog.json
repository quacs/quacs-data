In the first half of the course, we will discuss some of the safety vulnerabilities of machine learning models, such as neural network robustness issues, and go over methods to alleviate these issues. In the second half, we will cover concepts from dynamical/autonomous system analysis and verification, once again with a focus on applying machine learning techniques and analyzing their safety. Students will get exposure to adversarial learning and reinforcement learning techniques, as well as to a number of neural network verification tools such as Reluplex, Verisig and others.",

The course provides an introduction to the theory and practice of statistical time series analysis. Topics covered include stationary and non-stationary stochastic processes, autoregressive and moving average (ARMA) models, model selection and estimation, state-space models and the Kalman filter, forecasting and forecast evaluation,  an outline of spectral techniques. While these fundamental techniques are remarkably successful, availability of large time series data sets motivates application of AI/ML methods. Thus we will cover various deep neural networks that are relevant to time series data including RNN, LSTM.",

Key topics covered include quantum programming, quantum algorithms, quantum compilation, memory management, quantum error mitigation and correction. Students will also engage with research papers, participate in discussions, and undertake a semester-long group research project. Prior knowledge of quantum computing is helpful but not mandatory.",

Many new projects are introduced each semester, though many ongoing and \"higher-profile\" projects are also undertaken. Overall, students are required to work on and contribute to open source projects, in particular through multiple commits (commit early, commit often), maintaining a blog, presenting their work and/or specific technical talks, mentoring other projects, etc. This project-based \"course\" may be taken multiple semesters, with grades based on clear effort and contributions rather than a project that meets all of its requirements.",
