    "description": "Introduction to Structures introduces the student of Architecture to the principles of structural mechanics and their application to basic architectural structures comprised primarily of wood. The fundamentals of statics are presented in order to gain an understanding of the way in which external forces produce internal stresses in individual members and, in essence, flow through the building system to be resolved at the foundation level. The principles of strength of materials are studied to understand how particular structural materials and configurations manage to resist these forces without unacceptable distortions, or even failure. Wood structural properties are studied in all their complexity as a means to internalize the more theoretical topics broached. Through in-class presentations, reading, homework and project work, computer lab, field trips, and case studies, the student will be aided in developing this intuitive (while practical) understanding. It is recognized that intuitions of building technologies are not acquired quickly but result from much study, observation, and practice. Introduction to Structures makes use of the several approaches above to ensure that the beginning student is provided with a broad, solid base for future structural investigations. WebCT will be used to expand the student's access to course materials and allow for a measure of distance learning. Sustainability: The following notions are introduced as important attributes of sustainable structures and construction: durability and service life\u00a0and life cycle cost."

The structural makeup of metals, ceramics, polymers, and composite materials is discovered and their resulting properties, costs, and life cycle consequences are clarified. An understanding of basic mechanical properties is established hands on by conducting tension, compression, and 3-point bending tests (mse-lab). Physical performance of material constructs as synergy between form and material properties is further illustrated. Experiments are conducted that introduce such major concepts as structural loading, properties of sections, and resulting system performance. Sustainability: The concept of life cycles is introduced; material and energy flows are tracked throughout the entire material life cycle. This will be accomplished alongside introducing major material groupings (metals, polymers, ceramics, and composites). Students come to realize that environmental concerns are directly related to structural composition and material availability. Consequences of resource extraction, distribution, manipulation, use, and disposal, reuse or recycle are addressed at both local and global scales. Selected field trips to materials extraction, processing, manufacturing, disposal, and recycling facilities are aimed to give physical meaning to the concept of life cycle."

In the 20th century, the movements of Cubism, Futurism, Neo-Plasticism, Constructivism, Purism, Surrealism, and Dadaism consisted of dynamic dialogs between architecture and painting. These exchanges allowed each to have a profound and deep impact upon the other. By contrast, in early 21st century, there seems to be all but a mute relationship between the two. This course intends to help break that silence. This course will begin to bridge the divide by establishing new connections between the current preoccupations with materials, procedures, and affects that are emerging in both contemporary painting and architecture. Twisted Siblings seeks to explore and discover new relationships between the most cutting-edge digital technologies and how painting may influence the expressive capacities of these technologies. As contemporary painting and architecture seek to establish future directions, a new dialog and exchange of ideas should be emerging, to ensure a dynamic and radical future for both. The course will consist of a series of lectures, discussions, and presentations. Students will be expected to research a number of individual architects, painters, and writers who are producing work of related interest.

The fundamentals of statics are presented in order to gain an understanding of the way in which external forces produce internal stresses in individual members and, in essence, flow through the building system to be resolved at the foundation level. The principles of strength of materials are studied to understand how particular structural materials and configurations manage to resist these forces without unacceptable distortions, or even failure. Wood structural properties are studied in all their complexity as a means to internalize the more theoretical topics broached. Through in-class presentations, reading, homework and project work, computer lab, field trips, and case studies, the student will be aided in developing this intuitive (while practical) understanding. It is recognized that intuitions of building technologies are not acquired quickly but result from much study, observation, and practice. Introduction to Structures makes use of the several approaches above to ensure that the beginning student is provided with a broad, solid base for future structural investigations. WebCT will be used to expand the student's access to course materials and allow for a measure of distance learning.

    "description": "This is a design-based studio that focuses on the integration of structural, technical, detail, zoning, and code-related issues with respect to the design of a moderate to large-scale building of civic importance. Such building types are (but not limited to) libraries, theaters, city halls, judicial buildings, educational buildings, etc. An important focus of the design project will be the relationship of the building to its urban context. An essential part of the design will involve programming of the building as well as responding to numerous learning outcomes defined by the NAAB (the accrediting agency for professional architecture programs) for a comprehensive design project. This course is required of all architecture students in the M.Arch. program."

The integration of building code requirements for fire protection, life safety, accessibility, building environmental systems, structure, construction, and materiality is central to the effective achievement of design intent. Students become aware of how these issues affect and inform design decisions. They learn to integrate technology, systems, and materials in the comprehensive resolution of building design and gain exposure to construction documents and design documentation. Construction and site visits are an integral part of the studio as is an integrated electronic media seminar on CAD applications. Students must coregister for ARCH 5380, Professional Practice 1, a concurrent 2-credit course that introduces codes, the regulatory process, agreements, contract documents, building design cost control, and administration.

    "description": "Works of architecture embody knowledge, ideas, and imagination that express formally, spatially, and materially the ways of living and values of the civilizations in which they occur. A select number of modern and contemporary buildings that represent a high degree of sophistication in the way their architects have approached the breadth of design issues both within and external to the programs of those works will be analyzed critically in order to ascertain the significance and relationships of the multiple systems of order inherent to a work of architecture. Reflecting on the knowledge and understandings acquired in all the previous courses in the history, theory, and criticism sequence, this course is a critical inquiry into the principal ideologies and premises of the most substantive architectural practices in the contemporary world. As such, the content of the course must necessarily evolve as the intellectual and cultural parameters of both theory and practice in the contemporary world change. This course is required of all architecture graduate students in the M.Arch. program."

First, students will learn the basics of digital signal processing, develop an understanding of measurement equipment and analysis methods for sound. The course will examine the ISO standards of room-acoustic measurements, develop students' research goals and a specific set of data to gather for their research. The course will also prepare the students with the fundamental knowledge on CATT Acoustic and/or EASE in geometrical modeling. Then the students and professors will visit a number of performance venues (e.g. EMPAC Concert Hall, and/ or other venues) and perform the room-acoustic measurements. Students will then work on analyzing and interpreting the research results. Practice measurements will be scheduled in the gallery or somewhere on campus before trips to performance halls. MATLAB will play a central role throughout all the classes (SRL I &amp; II) and the thesis research projects. It will be used during the class exercises. Within one week from the semester start, every student is required to INSTALL a functioning MATLAB Software package onto her/his laptop computer.\n\nB.S. and B.
