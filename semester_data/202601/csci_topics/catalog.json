    "description": "Machine learning (ML) has demonstrated superior performance in many areas and has increasingly been deployed in real-world critical applications. However, the vulnerabilities and privacy risks of ML models could put public safety and user privacy in danger. Existing studies have shown that the ML applications such as financial analytics and autonomous vehicles are vulnerable to attacks that can manipulate the models to their malicious ends. This course will introduce potential vulnerabilities of ML models, recent research and future directions about the security and privacy problems in real-world machine learning systems. We will cover different types of attacks against computer systems leveraging ML as well as defense techniques, privacy-preserving ML, and robustness and fairness in ML. Students will familiarize themselves with the emerging body of literature on each topic, understand different algorithms, analyze security vulnerabilities, and develop the ability to conduct research projects on related topics.",

A primary focus of the course is to identify the disruptors in the two technologies from a research lens. Specifically, we intend to discuss how leveraging blockchain technology can benefit AI and how applying AI can enhance the capabilities of blockchain technology. Furthermore, students are encouraged to think about the impact of these two technologies on society. Topics discussed in the course include blockchain fundamentals, smart contracts, web3, federated machine learning, and decentralized applications that combine AI and blockchain technologies.",

Once these abilities are sufficiently well developed, robots will become safe and autonomous, thus paving the way for pervasive personal robots. Topics include: configuration space representation, cell decomposition, roadmap methods, rapidly-exploring random trees, simultaneous localization and mapping, contact modeling, grasping, and dexterous manipulation.",
