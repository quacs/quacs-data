Science by the People: Participation, Power, and the Politics of Environmental Knowledge, co-authored with Aya Kimura, compares case studies in the United States, Japan, Mexico, and other parts of the world, where citizen scientists have investigated the impacts of shale oil and gas, nuclear power, and genetically engineered crops. Seeds, Science, and Struggle: The Global Politics of Transgenic Crops focuses on farmers and activists in Mexico and Canada who organized in defense of alternatives to industrialized agriculture. Dr. Kinchy led the Watershed Knowledge Mapping Project, a study of volunteer watershed monitoring projects in Pennsylvania and New York. This research examined social conflicts surrounding unanswered scientific questions about the impacts of shale gas \"fracking.\" The study combined interviews, participant observation, surveys of water monitoring organizations, and GIS mapping of water monitoring activities. Dr. Kinchy also studied other dimensions of the fracking controversy, such as the disclosure of industry information about chemicals used in the fracking process and the risks of transporting oil by rail. This project led her to co-organize STS Underground, a research network that advances social science research on the technoscientific dimensions of mining, burial, and other forms of subterranean exploration. Her newest project, Nuestros Suelos/Our Soil, explores how citizen science and novel sensors could help urban and residential communities identify heavy metal contamination in soil. She is writing a book about how scientists, decision-makers, and affected communities attempt to reduce the harms caused by lead-contaminated soil in different places around the world. She is also working with a team at RPI to develop novel sensors that will enhance the public's capacity to recognize and respond to soil pollution.",

    "research": "Alicia Walf's research interests are fueled by the broad question: Why are there individual differences in stress? This question led her to studying hormones' actions for growth and plasticity in the brain and body. She has since refined my pursuit to include consideration of body, brain, and mind relationships as they relate to memory, perception, social cognition and emotions. A current focus is to understand the contextual variables important for these effects of hormones for these behavioral and cognitive processes. Dr. Walf has taken a cross-species and cross-discipline approach. Similarities across species for stress and hormone effects are important to note as they suggest common mechanisms across mammals, likely including humans as well, in the brain and body responses to challenges. Estradiol has novel actions for brain and body growth: Dr. Walf has investigated the effects, brain regions, and receptor targets of estradiol across endogenous cycles over the adult rodent lifespan as well as effects of different dosing of estradiol or other estrogenic drugs for affective behavior (e.g. stress, anxiety, fear) in the hippocampus and amygdala (regions of the limbic system). These studies in animal models corroborated what was being found in the clinical literature; that is, variability in the effects of estradiol were due to many contextual variables, including, the individuals' age, previous hormonal and behavioral experiences, stress responsiveness, and health. Despite these promising findings, the growth effects of estradiol required further consideration. A major consideration in studying steroid hormones, like estradiol, is that they cannot be contained; that is, they move through the circulatory system and cellular membranes in the brain as well as the rest of the body with relative ease. The specificity of steroids' effects lies in where receptors are and how steroids can act on them. Because a basic function of steroids is to induce growth, there is potential for increasing growth in estradiol-sensitive body tissues, associated with reproductive cancers. Studies supported by a grant from the Department of Defense Breast Cancer Research Program demonstrated that estradiol's functional effects in the hippocampus, but not proliferation in the body, involve ERbeta, a newly-discovered type of estrogen receptor. These studies also demonstrated that the mechanisms of estradiol for affect/emotions and memory in the hippocampus are not as distinct as previously argued and may involve novel hormone targets. Dr. Walf's research productivity and use of novel approaches in the field was recognized by her receiving a competitive and prestigious award, the inaugural Luciano Martini Prize for Young Investigators in Neuroendocrinology, named in honor of a trailblazer in the study of neurosteroids. Hormones' rapid effects to alter behavior and behaviors' rapid effects to alter hormones: Dr. Walf's work in hormone mechanisms relating to cognitive and emotional aspects of stress focus on the rapid effects of hormones through novel receptor and intracellular signaling targets in brain regions, such as the reward pathway and limbic system. These studies contribute to the field by showing that the effects of hormones for behavior are bidirectional, with hormones altering many behaviors (e.g. reproduction, learning, social interactions, stress) as well as these behaviors themselves changing hormones, such as neurosteroids (steroid hormones made in the brain), and thereby brain plasticity. This is a key finding relating to how hormones may alter brain and behavioral plasticity, and has continued to drive her research. Individual differences in response to stress and hormones in the context of brain and body health: Dr. Walf's overarching current research aim is elucidating the mechanisms of hormones in the brain as integrators of the internal and external environment as it relates to stress and well-being. These studies are currently being conducted using different approaches in human subjects. Her drive for pursuing the research goals on understanding described above is not only fueled by curiosity, but to provide hands-on training and mentoring of students in research of these clinically-relevant questions relating to hormones in the brain and body. Students are welcome to contact Dr. Walf about getting involved in these studies. Short descriptions of some current projects: 1) Studies on understanding well-being and mechanisms of contemplative practice within specific contexts are examples of current research investigating body and brain relationships as they are related to well-being and resiliency. For example, studies are ongoing about mindful/attentional practices for stress responding and higher cognitive processes, such as creativity. These are studies done to understand effects and mechanisms, but also to incorporate best practice in supporting growth, resiliency, and well-being in the classroom. 2) Another way to study hormones as integrators of the external and internal environment is to investigate these effects in collaboration with artists and architects. For example, Dr. Walf and collaborators investigate how artistic practice and performance and characteristics of built environments may alter cognitive performance and stress responses in human subjects. 3) To understand risk factors for age-related changes in emotional and cognitive function, in-person and web-based testing is being conducted. A novel risk factor being investigated is changes in sense of smell and whether olfactory training can be a potential prevention technique for Alzheimer's Disease and other neurodegenerative brain diseases.",
    "teaching": "Dr. Walf's focus on engaging in behaviors that encourage growth is not limited to research endpoints, but also her teaching approach and the behaviors that she engages in to support growth in the various communities she is part of and can support. Dr. Walf is committed to training, mentorship, and educational outreach. She is driven to support a diverse and inclusive environment in the classroom and beyond to promote well-being and resiliency to stress.

His research and teaching expertise include critical communication and cultural studies, technology and audience studies, media theory, and global media ethics. Fitzgerald is currently starting a lab at RPI to use the \"Screenomics\" screen-capture research framework that collects screenshots of participants devices every few seconds for longitudinal studies to conduct critical digital audience and mobile user studies. He is interested in connecting with potential collaborators, and is also interested in advising doctoral students in the areas of digital politics and media ethics, and critical audience/user studies. Fitzgerald received his Ph.D. in Communication from Stanford University in June of 2022. His dissertation, \"Mediatizing Terrorism: A Study of Audiences' Construction of Violent Events under Datafied Capitalism,\" explored the circulation and public reception of accounts of a series of Daesh terrorist attacks in Europe during the spring of 2017 as observed in Screenomics participants' platform and mobile ecosystems. Fitzgerald's academic research has been published in peer-reviewed journals including Communication Theory, Journal of Media Ethics, Journal of Communication Inquiry, and Human-Computer Interaction, and presented at conferences including the International Communication Association (ICA), Society for the Social Studies of Science (4S), and the Association of Internet Researchers (AoIR).

    "research": "I am currently focused on a book manuscript and journal articles drawing on my dissertation research, and starting up a lab at RPI conducting critical audience and user studies utilizing a data collection framework called Screenomics that collects screenshots from consenting participants\u2019 devices every few seconds for longitudinal studies. The lab will explore how the interweaving of data-driven social media platforms and mobile devices across categories of life and social action shapes users\u2019 construction of their digital lives and realities, and our broader political climate in turn. Immediate research areas include mediatized violence, particularly terrorism, and its circulation and reception in platform-centric mobile media environments, and far-right authoritarian subjectivization and conspiratorial discourses. Potential research avenues for students and future collaborators could include these areas as well as platform politics and governance, global comparative studies of mobile user cultures and mediatized violence and event construction. My dissertation, Mediatizing Terrorism: A Study of Audiences' Construction of Violent Events Under Datafied Capitalism, studied the circulation of transnational mobile media accounts of terror attacks in order to examine the intersection of violence, liberalism, and authoritarianism as it is transformed in the data-driven political economy of communication. The dissertation\u2019s central question asks: how is mediatized terrorism encountered, made sense of, and responded to by audiences in datafied media systems? To answer, I used screenomics to observe U.S. mobile media users\u2019 responses to a wave of ISIS terror attacks in Europe in the spring of 2017. These responses were captured unobtrusively every five seconds, affording examination of transnationally mediated accounts of terrorist attacks viewed on users\u2019 mobile devices across platforms and contexts using coterminous observation, revealing in fine detail how audiences truly use their mobile devices, platforms, and how they respond to attacks as they unfold. Based on this observation, I identified four mediatized rituals in response to terrorist attacks as they occur: one, a contingent of responses to terrorism in far-right ecosystems, assimilates attacks and unrelated social conflict into an imagined future of what liberal multiculturalism portends, creating the possibility for offline action stoking and reinforcing cycles of violence; the other three micro rituals comprise a limited suite of individualized responses to distant crises that are habituated by the data-driven political economy. My analysis stands in contrast to the dominant critiques of data-driven social media such as the de-ritualization of media and political polarization by highlighting both the persistence of media rituals as well as the distinct threat posed by ritual action in far-right mobile media specifically.\u200b",

    "biography": "Arturo Estrella has published extensively in various fields within economics, including macroeconomic theory, empirical macroeconomics, monetary policy, financial regulation, econometric theory, applied econometrics, and financial markets, instruments, and institutions. \u201cI like to look at how the financial sector interacts with the real economy. For example, interest rates and stock prices incorporate information about investor expectations of future real economic activity and inflation. Can we extract those expectations from the data and put them to use in policy analysis or investment strategy? Also, bank lending is a major driving force for real economic activity. How does this channel operate? What drives bank lending itself? How is it affected by financial regulation?\u201d In 1988-89, he developed (with Gikas Hardouvelis) a probit model of the probability of a future recession. Since then, the model has correctly forecasted the last three U.S. recessions in real time with a lead time of about one year and no false positives. Professor Estrella has also written extensively about financial regulation, proposing in 1995 an innovative system for bank capital regulation that has the potential to prevent systemic problems arising from the failure of large financial institutions. From 1991 to 2001, he represented the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in international negotiations on bank regulation under the auspices of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. In econometrics, Professor Estrella derived a pseudo R-squared for dichotomous dependent variable models that outperforms other alternatives, including the classic McFadden measure. The measure has become part of the standard output in many widely-used econometric packages. He has also provided exact critical and probability values for use in time-series breakpoint tests in connection with generalized method of moments estimates. His most recently published work includes \u201cSovereign and Banking Sector Debt: Interconnections through Guarantees\u201d in OECD Financial Market Trends, \u201cMonetary Tightening Cycles and the Predictability of Economic Activity\u201d in Economics Letters, and \u201cThe Yield Curve as a Leading Indicator: Some Practical Issues\u201d in Current Issues in Economics and Finance. He is currently working on a number of articles, including \u201cSovereign Guarantees on Private Bank Debt: Effects on Credit Ratings and Credit Default Swap Spreads\u201d (with Sebastian Schich), \u201cThe Credit Channel: Impact and Observability in a New Keynesian Model\u201d Presented at the 17th International Conference on Computing in Economics and Finance of the Society for Computational Economics, \u201cTerm Premiums and the Predictability of Recessions\u201d (with Hao Wu).

    "research": "Bacteria are the most abundant organisms on earth. They are found almost every possible biological niche, from ordinary soil to deep oceans and geological formations. They also interact with the human body; some bacteria are essential for life while others can be deadly. The ability of bacteria to flourish in such a wide range of environments is due in large part to the enzymes that populate their cell membranes. These enzymes make up the active interface between the cell and the environment. One of their roles is to ensure the interior of the cell is a hospitable place for the biochemistry of life in spite of changing and often hostile conditions outside. Among the most important of these membrane enzymes are the ones that transport ions into and out of the cell. These ion transporters are essential for maintaining favorable concentrations of ions inside the cell, but ion transport is also at the heart of energy production in the cell. Transport of H+ and Na+ create gradients that provide energy for processes as diverse as motility of the cell, import of nutrients and extrusion of chemicals that are toxic to the cell--the latter is responsible for a significant class of antibiotic resistance. The focus of my research is the physiology and biochemistry that allow bacteria to adapt and proliferate in diverse environments. In particular, we are interested in understanding the role of ion gradients involved in producing energy and maintaining stable, favorable internal conditions in spite of changing environments. We work on 3 interrelated projects: 1) Energy metabolism of the gut bacterium Bacteroides fragilis, where we are investigating a new paradigm in which this organism, previously classified as a strict anaerobe, actually depends on aerobic respiration for its survival and role in the community of intestinal microflora. 2) Adaptation to changing environments by the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, focusing on enzymes that generate and consume the Na+ and H+ gradients and how these systems function and interoperate. 3) Functional and mechanistic studies of two redox-driven Na+ pumping enzymes: NQR and RNF from Vibrio cholerae and other bacteria. The projects in my laboratory range from basic microbiology, characterizing the physiology of bacteria and their interactions with other cells, to biophysical chemistry, spectroscopy (visible, fluorescence, FTIR, and EPR) and rapid kinetics in order to understand the molecular mechanisms of ion transport and energy production enzymes. We study Vibrio cholerae, the cause of the disease cholera, Pseudomonas aeruginos a which are implicated in cystic fibrosis, as well as Bacteroides fra gilis, which are beneficial gut bacteria, and use infection models including mice, macrophages, and fruit flies. We are particularly interested in two enzymes: Na+-pumping NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (NQR), a respiratory enzyme found only in bacteria that uniquely pumps Na+ instead of H+, and Na+ pumping Ferredoxin:NAD oxidoreductase (RNF). These enzymes, are found in many pathogens, marine bacteria, and colon bacteria and are important for adaptation and proliferation of these organisms in diverse environments. In the case of NQR, my group defined the redox cofactors of the enzyme, their redox reactions, the pathway of electron transfer through these cofactors, and which of these electron transfer steps are linked to energy conservation. We are currently trying to understand the pathway that carries Na+ across the membrane and the mechanism that couples the redox reactions to this uphill transport of Na+.",

His research on these topics contributes to the development of the ecological and dynamical systems approaches to perception and action. \u201cIf you have ever been awed by the performance of a professional athlete, then you can appreciate some of the challenges that are faced when executing a skilled action,\u201d said Fajen. \u201cSuch tasks require rapid decision-making, anticipation, and coordination. In the Perception and Action Lab at RPI, my students and I use immersive virtual environments and motion capture technology to study how people navigate through complex, dynamic environments, and perform perceptual-motor skills such as running to catch a fly ball and blocking a penalty shot in soccer. We hope to inspire ideas for designing more sophisticated robots, develop new training programs for teaching complex motor skills, and improve the diagnosis and treatment of problems that affect the perceptual and motor systems.\u201d One current area of research is the \u201cRough Terrain Project,\u201d which investigates how humans and other animals are able navigate uneven terrain. In this project, Fajen and his students are exploring how visual information is used to walk over rough terrain with irregularly-spaced safe footholds. They have developed a novel experimental paradigm in which subjects walk over an array of randomly distributed virtual obstacles that are projected onto the floor by a LCD projector while their movements are recorded using a full-body motion capture system. This setup allows them to synchronize the appearance of obstacles with the movement of the subject. For example, in one experiment, obstacles appear only when they lie within a moving window of visibility centered on the subject. By manipulating the size of the window of visibility, they are measuring how far along the future path visual information is needed to control foot placement. As director of the Perception and Action (PandA) Laboratory, Fajen publishes regularly, with recent articles appearing in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, PLOS ONE, Perception, and the Handbook of Spatial Cognition. Fajen is the recipient of a four-year grant from the National Institutes of Health for a project titled \"The visual guidance of locomotion,\u201d and, in addition to his teaching and research, he is associate editor of Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance.",

By using a case study approach, students are immediately immersed into understanding high-dimensional data and provided with a fundamental toolkit with which they can analyze data throughout their careers. Another effort is to contribute to the retention of STEM majors by enabling upper class students to act as mentors for first year students in Calculus courses. This provides leadership experience for the mentors and guidance for the Freshman on how to succeed in STEM. Shape preserving interpolation is an area of interest in Computer Aided Geometric Design and Approximation Theory. Specific problems of interest include the preservation of monotonic curvature and the reated problems of preserving 3-convexity and finding novel representations of surfaces for the task of convexity preserving surface interpolation.",

Nominating Committee, National Academy of Sciences, 2011-2013 \tLong-range Planning Committee, Mineralogical Society of America, 2011 -- Research interests My research focuses on chemical phenomena that occur within the Earth and terrestrial planets, with emphasis on the outer 100 kilometers of the Earth. I use laboratory devices in the basement of the Jonsson-Rowland Science Center to achieve conditions of elevated pressure and temperature that exist within the Earth, and I conduct experiments designed to characterize fundamental materials properties and behavior at these conditions (my research could thus be described as \"materials science of the Earth\"). Measurements of interest include equilibrium partitioning (distribution) of the chemical elements and their isotopes among coexisting phases (crystals, silicate melts and supercritical fluids), as well as rates of reaction and especially diffusion. Broadly speaking, the goals of my work are to understand the internal workings of the Earth and terrestrial planets through experimentation and modeling, and to provide tools that will allow ourselves and other geoscientists to \"reverse engineer\" Earth materials to gain insight into our planet's history. My laboratory facilities and skill set are well suited to the study of all types of materials under pressure, which has led to fruitful collaborations with RPI researchers in the departments of Physics, Materials Science and Chemistry on topics ranging from RNA polymerization to high-pressure mechanical properties of glasses. As a member of RPI's Astrobiology Center, I developed a strong focus on characterizing the conditions of earliest Earth (4+ billion year ago)\u2015the stage upon which early life took hold. This interest will continue as a part-time theme in my research group; however, my interest in the fundamental basis of environmental proxies\u2014that is, chemical or isotopic signatures that inform us about past environments\u2015extends to the recent geological past and the use of knowledge gained from proxies to predict future trends.",

He earned a Ph.D. degree from the Ohio State University in Management Sciences (with a minor in Computer Science), MS in Industrial and Systems Engineering from Ohio State University, and BS in Industrial Engineering from Tunghai University, Taiwan. He served on Rensselaer's Faculty Council, Faculty Senate, and various other academic committees at the school and institute levels (e.g., the Institute-wide BS-IT and MS-IT curricula committees). He has been a keynote speaker to a number of international meetings in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Thailand, Italy, and Canada, as well as in the US. Dr. Hsu is currently engaging in research on service science, with a focus on service design and system design. He developed a thoery of Digital Connections Scaling to help explain the dynamics of new service in the connected world. The theory recognizes population-wide connected value cocreation among persons and organizations as a transforming mode of production for Knowledge Economy, and thereby analyzes new busness designs and service system design laws. A new model accompanies the theory: Hyper-Networks, which engages the emerging network science to provide insights into the analytic nature of connected value cocreation. New system design methods aim at helping scale IS up to the populations of customers, providers, and resources; down to individual users; and transformational to cross-sectional collaboration. The theory is also suported by such results as instrumentation of the environments (using, e.g., RFID systems, wireless sensor networks), Cyber-Infrastructure-Assisted Enterprises, and the market approach to open and scalable information exchange. He is a believer of person-centered models on the Internet. In addition to the above original work on serfvice science, Dr. Hsu is also devoted to studying sustainability design for products and production systems, and alternative energy system design for micro grids at the community level.

    "research": "My lab studies the folding and design of proteins, enzymes, vaccine antigens, and biosensors. When I came here in 1999, I was a bioinformaticist and my lab worked exclusively in computational biology. Since then, we have evolved into a mostly experimental lab, with a little computation still mixed in. Our early work included algorithm development in protein structural bioinformatics, including structure prediction, contact map prediction, local structure prediction, hidden Markov models, sequence alignment, molecular surface area calculation, torsion space molecular dynamics, simplified representations for molecular dynamics, bioinformatics-driven force fields, structure-based alignment, and models for folding pathways. We proposed the \"phone cord effect\" to explain superhelicity in alpha helical crossovers. Starting about ten years ago, we began doing experimental work on green fluorescent protein (GFP) with the help of molecular biologist Prof. Donna E. Crone. We created a non-circularly permuted \"re-wired\" GFP, a permuted and truncated \"leave-one-out\" GFP, a variant that folds faster and more efficiently, and a GFP-base biosensor. We inserted strategically-placed disulfides to test specific hypotheses for the folding pathway of GFP and reasoned out the presence of two specific folding intermediates. More recently we are studying the formation of the fluorescent chromophore and the dependence of GFP fluorescence on specific residues and on thermodynamic stability. The principle thrust of the lab is to develop the leave-one-out (LOO) method for GFP-based biosensors. By combining computational design and high throughput screening, we find sets of mutations that complement a specific bound peptide and allow the truncated LOO-GFP to fold and glow only in the presence of a target protein which has been unfolded to expose that sequence. A biosensor for detection of H5N1 influenza virus hemagglutinin was published in 2015. We are collaborating on the development of a sensor for dengue virus and putting those sensors on protein fibers. We are also engaged in a collaborative effort to develop a contraceptive vaccine. The vaccine will produce temporary and reversible infertility. Instead of having to take an action to be protected, you will be protected by default, and would need to take an action to be temporarilly fertile again. The vaccine targets the sperm-specific calcium channel CatSper, which is required for sperm hyperactive motility and therefore for fertility. Sperm antigens are placed on the surface of non-infectious virus-like particles (VLP) for vaccination. A contraceptive vaccine is a humane way to deal with global overpopulation. Overpopulation is widely believed to be the root cause of anthropogenic climate change, overfishing, fresh water depletion, war, famine etc. -- in short, overpopulation is an existential threat. I recently published a computational model, called World4, for global population, predicting that a peak is coming soon. The good news is that by making every child a wanted child, population growth can be stopped humanely. My lab is using chimeric constructs of Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) L1 protein as a self-assmbling virus-like nanoparticle. Theses particle raise strong immunity to epitopes on their surface. We are placing CatSper loops on the surface for a contracpetive vaccine, SARS-CoV2 spike protein loops on the surface as a glycan-free COVID vaccine, and metastatic cancer biomarkers for a late-stage cancer immunotherapeutic. This versatile chimeric-HPV technology has many applications in epitope-directed vaccine design. This work was made possible by our collaborators, the Center for Computational Innovation (CCI), and Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Sciences (CBIS), and by grants from the NSF, NIH, Rosetta Commons, and a private foundation.",

    "biography": "Our research group is primarily engaged in medicinal chemistry and organic synthetic chemistry. Currently, our laboratory is pursuing drug discovery research in areas that include 1) ophthalmic indications, 2) indications associated with elevated RBP4 expression, 3) TTR amyloidosis, 4) COVID-19, and 5) neuropathic pain. Training in our laboratory will involve organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry at its core, with significant exposure to pharmacology, ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion), and drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics. Medicinal Chemistry Our lab contains state-of-the-art microwave synthesis technology, automated normal and reverse phase chromatography, and analytical HPLC and LCMS capability. We also have access to the Biomolecular NMR, Proteomics, and Analytical Biochemistry Core Facilities at RPI. Our projects utilize structural biology and computational chemistry to assist with drug design and we largely focus on preparing small molecule matrix libraries using state-of-the-art synthetic methods to elucidate structure-activity relationships (SAR) trends, modulate physicochemical properties, and optimize DMPK characteristics. Synthetic Organic Chemistry Pursuit of novel synthetic methodology development that may have broad utility within the organic synthetic and medicinal chemistry communities is also highly encouraged. Opportunities to explore and publish novel reactions is a component of the training provided within our laboratory. Key Project Highlights: Glycine Transporter 2 (GlyT2) Inhibitors \u2013 Neuropathic Pain: We are engaged in an NIH-funded collaborative drug discovery project with the University of Sydney that focuses on developing novel and orally bioavailable GlyT2 inhibitors for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Approximately 116 million adults in the US suffer from chronic pain, which presents an incidence rate greater than that for sufferers of cancer, heart disease, and diabetes combined. Estimated associated US annual costs range from a staggering $560 to $635 billion and are projected to escalate. Despite the high level of prevalence and enormous socioeconomic burden incurred, pharmacological treatment of chronic pain remains limited as it is often refractory to currently available analgesics and many of these agents induce severe dose-limiting side effects or present a risk of tolerance, addiction, and abuse. The dearth of effective therapeutics for chronic pain has led to an overreliance on opioid medications, which are now the most commonly prescribed class of medications in the US and are fueling a national epidemic of overdose deaths and addictions. Thus, the discovery and development of new analgesics that are more effective and devoid of abuse and addiction liabilities remains a critical unmet need. Recent insights into the physiological adaptations underlying chronic pain have encouraged efforts to discover new classes of pain-relieving drugs that can selectively target these mechanisms. Among the myriad of cellular and molecular processes identified as contributing to pathological pain, disinhibition of spinal cord nociceptive signaling to higher cortical centers plays a critical role. Evidence suggests that impaired glycinergic neurotransmission develops in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord in neuropathic pain models and is an important CNS mechanism causing mechanical hyperalgesia (amplified pain signaling) and allodynia (a painful response to normally innocuous stimuli). Therefore, it has been hypothesized that agents capable of augmenting glycinergic tone within the dorsal horn may be able to obtund aberrant nociceptor signaling to the brain and serve as a novel class of analgesics. Indeed, drugs that enhance dysfunctional glycinergic transmission in neuropathic pain, and in particular inhibitors of GlyT2, are generating widespread interest. GlyT2 inhibitors have demonstrated broad analgesic efficacy in several preclinical models of varying pain modalities and could present a novel class of analgesics that are differentiated from current standard of care. Bispecific Retinol Binding Protein 4 (RBP4) Antagonists/Transthyretin (TTR) Tetramer Kinetic Stabilizers \u2013 Atrophic Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) and Stargardt Disease: Accumulation of cytotoxic lipofuscin bisretinoids may contribute to atrophic age-related macular degeneration (AMD) pathogenesis, which is the most prevalent form of AMD. Retinal bisretinoid synthesis depends on the influx of serum all-trans-retinol delivered via a tertiary RBP4\u2212TTR\u2212retinol complex. We previously identified selective RBP4 antagonists, such as clinically investigated tinlarebant, that dissociate circulating RBP4\u2212TTR\u2212retinol complexes, reduce serum RBP4 levels, and inhibit bisretinoid synthesis in models of enhanced retinal lipofuscinogenesis. However, the release of TTR by selective RBP4 antagonists may be associated with TTR tetramer destabilization and, potentially, TTR amyloid formation. We are currently engaged in an NIH-funded drug discovery project in collaboration with Columbia University that focuses on the identification of bispecific RBP4 antagonist\u2212TTR tetramer kinetic stabilizers, which may be especially important as a therapy for atrophic AMD patients who have another common age-related comorbidity, senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA), a nongenetic disease associated with wild-type TTR misfolding. These bispecific compounds also present potential therapeutic utility for treating Stargardt disease, an inherited form of macular degeneration. Novel Antiviral Drugs \u2013 COVID-19: We have entered into an NIH-funded collaborative drug discovery project with the Scripps Research Institute to identify novel antiviral drugs for treating COVID-19 ( https://www.campp.org). This project is part of the multidisciplinary Center for Antiviral Medicines and Pandemic Preparedness (CAMPP), which was selected as one of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Antiviral Drug Discovery (AViDD) Centers for Pathogens of Pandemic Concern. The AViDD Centers' program is one of the U.S. government\u2019s responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and is aimed at the near-term development of drugs against viruses with high pandemic potential \u2014 including coronaviruses, filoviruses (such as Ebola virus), flaviviruses (yellow fever virus, dengue virus, Zika virus), paramyxoviruses, bunyaviruses, and togaviruses.",

I am also interested in \"new\" military history. My first book, Nationalizing France's Army: Foreign, Black and Jewish Troops in the French Military, 1715-1831 (University of Virginia Press, 2016), used military service by outsiders to France's national community as a lens for analyzing the formulation of national identity, nationality and xenophobia in Europe's first major modern democratic society. My current book project, which I am coauthoring with an industry practitioner and which is under contract with Springer, examines the trend of developer advocacy and its role in shaping the experience of software development practices. My teaching centers on the history and culture of technology via courses such as \"IT and Society\" and \"History of Science and Technology.\" I also offer some courses that focus less narrowly on technology, including RPI's American history survey and a local history course that focuses on the history of RPI and Troy. In addition to my scholarly work, I write frequently on a freelance basis for a variety of media outlets on topics such as software development, open source and the IT industry.

    "biography": "Director of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Center for Biotechnology & Interdisciplinary Studies (CBIS), conducting breakthrough research on bones, Deepak Vashishth, PhD, is working to redefine the role of a top tier research university: one that is engaged in public and private partnerships, involved in interdisciplinary research, and providing quality education, all to drive entrepreneurial, sustainable, socially responsible scientific discovery and technological innovation. Administrative leadership: Through his work as a University Center Director, previously as a School of Engineering Department head, and in professional societies he has successfully developed partnerships, Programs, and platforms, to drive translational scientific research across disciplines, sectors,and geographic boundaries. As Director of CBIS he oversees 70 resident and non-resident faculty (from each of the five Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute schools); engages with global partners in the public, private, and academic sectors; and fosters innovative graduate and undergraduate research and education initiatives. In his first two years as CBIS Director he has: envisioned and facilitated the creation of two transformative research centers (Bioimaging Center and Center for Translational Research in Medicine); led the development of an industry partners program to enhance technology transfer and commercialization; and broadened the scope of interdisciplinary research by combining biotechnology with architecture, humanities, and management. As Department Head of Biomedical Engineering (BME) in the School of Engineering at Rensselaer, in just 3 years he dramatically grew and strengthened the department: increased tenured faculty tenfold (1 to 10); added a senior endowed chair to its rank; and it became home to 7 NSF career awardees and recipient of more than 10 NIH RO1 awards (from 2 in 2009). As a committee member of the Orthopaedic Research Society, he developed and facilitated a \u201cSymposium in Translational Medicine\u201d designed to accelerate the transition of discoveries from lab bench to bedside by bridging the gap between clinical, basic science & engineering, government agencies (FDA) and industry. Research leadership: Dr. Vashishth\u2019s research interests are in the area of biomolecular science and engineering of extracellular matrix with particular emphasis on diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis and bone tissue engineering. His collaborative, interdisciplinary bone research is redefining how osteoporosis will be diagnosed and treated. In 2012 he was elected Fellow of the American Institute of Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE) for contributions to the understanding of how both age and collagen\u2010modification affect bone fragility (cited over 1000 times). AIMBE fellows represent the top 2% of the medical and biological engineering community in the world and are elected based on nomination and vote by AIMBE fellows ( http://aimbe.org/college-of-fellows/cof-1479/ ). He has opened new avenues for diagnosing and treating osteoporosis by developing a new technique to identify bone proteome from nanoscale samples. The process also has been applied for analyzing precious fossils. He is bringing his breakthrough research to market, co-founding a company (Orthograft plc), to produce the acellular biomimetic grafts for bone repair. Professor Vashishth and his research group have published over 200 peer-reviewed journal publications and conference proceedings in top journals including PNAS, Molecular and Cellular Proteomics, Plos One and others. His work presented in the form of over 100 invited and contributed lectures has been cited as a \u201cNew Hope for Osteoporosis Patients\u201d and \u201cSecret Formula for Bone Strength\u201d in mainstream media. Working in collaboration with others, his research group has identified new structural roles for bone proteins and developed new biomimickry-based strategies for tissue engineering scaffolds. In addition to being a Fellow of and active in the AIMBE, he serves as a member of the National Institutes of Health study section on Skeletal Biology and Skeletal Regeneration. He is a board member of the Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials and a regular reviewer for other federal and international funding agencies, private foundations and university grants, and journals. He also is a member of the Biomedical Engineering Society, American Society of Bone and Mineral Research and the Orthopaedic Research Society. Educational leadership: Fundamentally focused on education, he is preparing the next generation of researchers and the \u201cfaculty of the future\u201d by infusing undergraduate and graduate programs with a more interdisciplinary, collaborative, global perspective on sustainable, translational scientific research. In recognition of his dedication to education, he has won Rensselaer awards for outstanding and innovative classroom teaching including the Class of 1951 Outstanding Teaching award. As CBIS Director, he established new global partnerships, redesigned graduate training programs, and developed a new course, all designed to prepare the \u201cfaculty of the future,\u201d focused on sustainable collaborative interdisciplinary research and technology transfer and commercialization. As BME department head (2009-2013): expanded the graduate program three-fold (from 20 to 60 students), attracted more highly qualified graduate students, and promoted early success (National fellowships). He overhauled curriculum, to enhance learning and to improve the undergraduate experience, by reducing class size and providing hands-on education in a technologically connected classroom. Background: He earned his B. Eng with honors from Malaviya National Institute of Technology (India), MS from West Virginia University (USA) and PhD from the University of London (UK). He then conducted post-doctoral research at the Bone and Joint Center, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Henry Ford Hospital before joining Rensselaer as an Assistant Professor in Biomedical Engineering in 1999.",

Drew works in the area of multiphase flows, which are flows in which more than one material moves. Applications include sedimentation, boiling filtration and separation. A common example of the latter is the separation of a carbonated beverage and its \u201chead\u201d. It is an exciting area because of the complexity which can occur in such flows, and also because the simplest set of equations you can write are \u201cill-posed\u201d \u2014 flawed in a very fundamental way. Even though the simplest equations are incorrect in this way, many predictions obtained from them appear believable. Should the right equations be very different from the wrong ones? To try to answer this question, Drew is examining solutions of the equations which represent special physical phenomena in the flows and how sensitive the predictions are to the equations. The physical phenomena include the formation and propagation of \u201cstructures\u201d in the flow, such as shocks and transitions, including the interface between the beverage and its foamy \u201chead\u201d. There are some deep physical questions encountered along the way. Specifically, one wants to know how the equations appear in different coordinate systems. Since coordinate systems are human inventions, the materials cannot know one from another. This gives information about the form the equations can take. Another question involves the concepts of entropy and disorder. The motion of liquid flowing around a bubble has a \u201cdisorder\u201d in it on the scale of the bubble size, but this is vastly different than the thermal motions usually treated with thermodynamic ideas. On the other hand, this \u201cdisorder\u201d associated with the motion cannot all be reordered, or recovered, without some expenditure of energy. Drew feels that results in this important technological area can give insights in other areas of mechanics, for example, in the relation between gas dynamics and the dynamics of a large collection of gas molecules.",

    "research": "Dr. Swank has been a member of the RPI faculty since 2005. He heads a dynamic, multidisciplinary laboratory of students, staff, and post-docs. His laboratory investigates how muscle is able to power an amazingly wide variety of locomotory tasks and modulate heart function. Research focuses in the lab include determining how variation between muscle fiber types (e.g. slow versus fast-contracting fibers) is generated, the mechanisms behind muscle mechanical properties such as stretch activation, and muscle diseases such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. An integrative approach is taken, starting with muscle genes and moving up in scale to protein expression and function, muscle mechanics, and whole organism studies. His research team primarily uses Drosophila for their studies, due to Drosophila's ease of genetic manipulation and mechanically testable muscles. However, we have recently started using mammalian muscle types to gain further insights. Dr Swank's lab has primarily focused on the role of myosin, the molecular motor that powers muscle contraction, in modulating muscle mechanical properties. Drosophila is currently the only system that can be transgenically manipulated to express a specific myosin isoform or mutant myosin in a specific muscle type. The expressed myosin can be isolated from Drosophila to measure single and ensemble biochemical and biophysical molecular properties such as ATPase rate and actin sliding velocity. Laboratory members also measure mechanical properties (e.g. power, velocity and force) of isolated muscle fibers expressing transgenic myosin and relate altered fiber properties to changes in locomotion, such as flight ability. Besides myosin, the laboratory also investigates the function of other muscle proteins such as muscle LIM protein (MLP), actin and troponin C. The lab investigates mechanisms behind several muscle and heart diseases such as familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and distal arthrogryposis. HCM is an inherited genetic disease that is the leading cause of sudden cardiac arrest among young adults. The lab creates transgenic Drosophila models of these diseases and perform experiments to determine how these disease states alter the mechanical function of muscle and to provide insights into possible treatments.",

There are 6 genes, thus far, linked to the inherited form of PD and they are: alpha synuclein, DJ-1, PINK1, Parkin, HTRA2 and dardarin. The current hypothesis regarding the onset of this neurological disorder and aging involves an increase in oxidative stress. The accumulation of oxidative damage to membranes, proteins, and DNA eventually kills the cell. PD genes play a role in protecting mitochondria against oxidative stress based on model systems. The question I am addressing using C. elegans, is what specific role these proteins play in reducing oxidative stress and maintaining mitochondrial integrity, i.e. what are the protein-protein interactions? I am using a variety of biochemical imaging approaches to look at when these proteins are expressed and eventually if they will interact with one another.",

    "research": "Our laboratory research program revolves around the themes of new technology development for protein structure production and computational analysis. Based on our experience as a central node for protein sample production and structure determination by NMR in the NIGMS PSI program, rigorous structure and dynamic analysis of small (< 15 kDa) proteins in our laboratory is largely automated and routine. However, most of our current research program focus on larger (> 20 kDa), more challenging systems, including integral membrane proteins and protein complexes. These projects require hybrid approaches, combining NMR data with X-ray crystallography, SAXS, paramagnetic NMR and EPR, and other biophysical methods, along with advanced computational modeling and structural bioinformatics. In order to ensure rigor in applying this broad range of methods, we collaborate intensively with internationally-recognized experts in these domains. For example, we work with experts to explore the impact of Evolutionary Coupling (C. Sander, D. Marks), Rosetta (D. Baker), and CHARMM (W. Im) modeling methods for determining 3D structures of larger proteins for which only sparse, incomplete experimental data is available, including integral membrane proteins. We also rely on our collaborators in paramagnetic NMR (C. Luchinat and G Parigi), SAXS (J. Tainer), fluorescence spectroscopy (C. Royer), EPR (M. Kennedy), and cryoEM (J. Hunt, K. Das) to provide expertise in these critical experimental methods. We also lead the structural biology components of several biomedical collaborations, including projects on viral-host protein/RNA interactions of influenza (with S. Patel, Rutgers) and murine leukemia (with M. Roth, Rutgers) viruses, SARS-CoV2 inhibitor development (with A. Garcia-Sastre, Mt. Sinai), DNA damage repair (with S. Bunting, Rutgers), and de novo protein design (with D. Baker, U Wash.). We also collaborate with the Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) program to organize efforts in sparse-NMR-guided structure prediction across the CASP community and AI-based methods for modeling multiple conformations of proteins, and with the wwPDB to develop robust and rigorous methods of protein and nucleic acid structure quality assessment. All of these collaborations are aimed at ensuring the highest rigor and quality control, and in addressing important biomedical questions.",

    "research": "Research in the laboratory is directed towards understanding the structural and thermodynamic basis of the contributions of individual molecular components to the functional dynamics of macromolecular complexes. In order to probe the role of different interactions in protein folding, stability and protein interactions with the ligands (ions, proteins, DNA, RNA, small effectors), a variety of experimental techniques as well as computational methods of analysis are used. Recombinant DNA technology is used to incorporate different amino acid residues into a given position in a protein sequence. The effect of these mutations on the overall energetics, structure and function of proteins is measured under different conditions such as salt concentration and ion type, temperature, and pH. Experimental techniques assessing energetics include scanning calorimetry, pressure-perturbation calorimetry, titration calorimetry, circular dichroism spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, stopped-flow kinetics, and analytical ultracentrifugation. Structural information on the systems is obtained using multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. Computer simulations are used to obtain atomistic details for individual model systems, and analyzed using AI and ML enhanced tools. Two main projects are under development in the laboratory. The first project studies physico-chemical basis of adaptation of organisms to high hydrostatic pressure at the level of individual macromolecules. Pressure is an important environmental variable that plays an essential role in biological adaptation for many extremophilic organisms, so called piezophiles. On Earth these organisms are generally populating the deep ocean floor where hydrostatic pressure can reach 110 MPa (~1,100 atm). Single cell organisms are not the only ones evolved to live under high hydrostatic pressure. The segmented microscopic animals tardigrades (\u201cwater bear\u201d) can survive pressures up to 6,000 atm in the dormant state. Pompeii worms (Alvinella pompejana) are species of polychaete worms that live at high pressure and temperature near hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor. More recently, several species of nematoda were identified in the deep terrestrial subsurfaces. Bacterial species have been isolated from 1,350 meters into the Earth crust where temperature reaches 102\u00b0C and pressure is estimated to be in excess of 3,000 atm. There are also reports of prokaryotic organisms at the bottom of the oil well sediments and deep in the Arctic ice. All these examples suggest the possibility of life forms on other planets even though the temperature and pressure conditions can be dramatically different from those on the surface of Earth. Such different temperature and pressure conditions are expected to be found under the ice crust on Mars, Jupiter's moon Europa, and Saturn's moon Enceladus. Using a novel method of pressure-perturbation calorimetry combined with protein engineering methods, detailed computer simulations, and AI/ML driven bioinformatics we are deciphering the role of different interactions in defining structural and functional state of proteins at high hydrostatic pressure. The second project deals with the mechanisms by amyloid fibrils formation using GFP as a molecular sensor. Insoluble protein aggregates called amyloid fibrils are linked to various human diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and type II diabetes. Our research demonstrates that regardless of their amino acid sequence, green fluorescent protein (GFP) can bind the core of amyloid fibrils. The interaction between GFP and amyloid fibrils is specific, as GFP does not interact to the monomeric forms of these peptides/proteins or other protein aggregates. GFP cannot bind to amyloid fibrils formed by large proteins that have a fuzzy coat surrounding the amyloid core. However, if protease digestion removes the fuzzy coat, GFP can detect the amyloid core of these fibrils. By using NMR, we have mapped the binding interface on GFP and validated it through mutagenesis. We proposed a FRET-based sensor for amyloid detection based on GFP's ability to bind amyloid fibrils for practical applications. We use a battery of biophysical methods (ThT fluorescence, circular dichroisms and deep-UV resonance Raman spectroscopies, NMR, analytical ultracentrifugation, small angle X-ray scattering, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry), biochemical methods (protease protection, bacterial expression, isotopic labeling), and computational method (replica-exchange molecular dynamic simulations) to identify key elements that are involved in the amyloid structure formation. The ultimate goal is to develop inhibitors that modify the fibrillation pathways.",

    "biography": "George Nagy graduated from McGill University in Engineering Physics (fencing and chess). He earned his MS at McGill by solving Euler's Second Equation for the hysteresis motor. He was awarded the PhD at Cornell University in 1962 for helping Frank Rosenblatt build Tobermory, a sixteen-foot, four-layer neural network for speech recognition. After a short postdoc he worked on character recognition and remote sensing at IBM Yorktown (and claims credit for IBM's growth during this period). During a reverse sabbatical at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al he recorded pulse trains from cats' medial geniculate nuclei. In 1972 he was appointed chairman of the Department of Computer Science at the University of Nebraska where he dabbled in computational geometry, GIS and HCI, and was eventually inducted in the NHC. Since 1985 he has been Professor of Computer Engineering at RPI in Troy, NY. Nagy's credits in document analysis include Chinese character recognition with Dick Casey, \"self-corrective\" character recognition with Glen Shelton (with a reprise twenty-eight years later with Henry Baird), character recognition via cipher substitution with Casey, Sharad Seth, and Tin Ho, growing X-Y trees with Seth, table interpretation with Dave Embley, Mukkai Krishnamoorthy, Dan Lopresti and Seth, modeling random-phase noise with Prateek Sarkar and Lopresti, style-constrained classification with Sarkar, Harsha Veeramachaneni, Hiromichi Fujisawa and Cheng-Lin Liu, and paper-based election systems research with Lopresti and Elisa Barney Smith. He tries to keep up with the state of the art by learning new ideas from former students. He is a Fellow of the IEEE and the IAPR, and received prematurely (in 2001) the ICDAR Lifetime Contributions Award. In his spare time Nagy enjoys skiing, sailing, and writing prolix surveys.

    "biography": "Glenn Ciolek is a theoretical and computational astrophysicist. His research focus has been in the theory of the interstellar medium, particularly astrophysical plasmas and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and their applications to star-forming molecular clouds and cores. This has included multifluid non-ideal MHD simulations (including dust grains) of shock waves in interstellar clouds, and numerical studies of gravitational collapse and fragmentation of protostellar cores. Working with his Rensselaer colleague, Prof. Wayne Roberge, he has developed a Riemann-Godunov numerical code using adaptive mesh refinement to investigate the time-dependent formation and nonlinear evolution of MHD shocks in weakly-ionized interstellar clouds. Some calculations have also employed parallel processing and the use of the supercomputers at the Center for Computational Innovations (CCI) at Rensselaer. Glenn is also interested in the astrobiological applications of his research, and has been associated with the New York Center for Astrobiology (NYCA) at Rensselaer.",

In both cases I have been instrumental in elucidating their substructure. I hope that these studies will contribute to our understanding of how the Galaxy formed. In addition, the stellar substructure in both the halo and in the disk can be used to determine where dark matter is located in the Milky Way galaxy. I currently run MilkyWay@home. I am also working on a telescope design that uses a giant diffraction grating to collect light instead of a large mirror; this design might allow a giant, light-weight telescope to be unfurled in space. I was a participant in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, from 1992 to 2008. This survey imaged 10,000 square degrees of the north Galactic cap in five optical filters. Additionally, it obtained a million spectra of the galaxies (and hundreds of thousands of QSOs and stars) that were detected in the imaging survey. I am also a participant in the Chinese LAMOST spectral survey of millions of Galactic stars, and led the US participation (Participants in LAMOST, US -- PLUS) in the design of that survey. I have worked in many areas of astronomy over the course of my career. I did my PhD with the Berkeley Automated Supernova Search, which measured the supernova rates as a function of supernova type in Virgo-distance galaxies; and the Supernova Cosmology Project, which is measuring the cosmological parameters Omega and Lambda using the light curves of distant supernovae. I have published papers in diverse areas of galactic and extragalactic astronomy, including: supernova phenomenology, measuring cosmological parameters from supernovae, galaxy photometry, color selection of QSOs, properties of stars, and the structure of our galaxy.",

    "biography": "Dr. James (Jim) Olson, Sr. Lecturer in the Department of Mechanical, Aerospace, and Nuclear Engineering, has extensive experience leading technical projects and teams in various private sector and U.S. military engineering environments including: Senior Engineer - Advanced Technology Operations at General Electric Co., Assistive Technology Development Consultant, and Technical Leader - Chemistry and Radiological Controls at U.S. Navy. Dr. Olson's non-traditional introduction to academia occurred when the Nuclear Engineering Department at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute launched the Navy-Malta Program, a remote campus near the Navy Training Facility in West Milton, NY that enabled active duty military personnel to earn a bachelor\u2019s of science in nuclear engineering and/or engineering physics. At that time, Dr. Olson was a Junior Instructor and compared the job offers for Senior Instructors that earned the Bachelor of Science at RPI to those that chose alternate paths and decided to earn the RPI degree as well. With insufficient time remaining on his Junior Instructor tour, Dr. Olson had to commit to a subsequent Senior Instructor tour at the West Milton Facility, after completing an operational assignment on a nuclear submarine, in order to achieve his goal. Dr. Olson was assigned to the USS ANNAPOLIS (SSN-760), a Los Angeles Class (688i) submarine in Groton, CT. in September 1999 and was quickly promoted to Technical Leader of the Chemistry and Radiological Controls Group where he oversaw several technology modernization implementations such as computer-based engineering documentation, novel chemistry control methods, and other classified technology-enabled operational transitions. Prior to September 11, 2001, Dr. Olson's primary responsibilities were monitoring and documenting operational factors related to retrofitting the novel chemistry control method such monitoring for potential deposits of radioactive corrosion products in low flow piping, identifying new trends in routine chemistry analyses, and resolving supply chain constraints for new chemical reagents. After the 9/11 Terror Attacks on the World Trade Center, Dr. Olson was tasked with the unprecedented responsibility of ensuring the nuclear reactor and steam plant chemistry controls remained within technical specification as the legacy Cold War submarine was increasingly tasked with unorthodox mission parameters, essentially invalidating the historic basis of common trend analysis techniques. Dr. Olson and his team had to develop predictive chemistry trend techniques, accounting for those trends related to the novel chemistry methods and the dynamic mission parameters. Although specific details remain classified, since the USS ANNAPOLIS was the test platform for a specific military intelligence technology, mission parameters were consistently pushed far beyond the original design parameters of the 688i submarine platform. Upon successful completion of the submarine tour, Dr. Olson was granted permission to be assigned as a Senior Instructor at the West Milton Facility on the condition that he agree to be the Technical Leader of the Chemistry and Radiological Controls Training Program to lead the upcoming curriculum modernization effort. Since the curriculum revision would require extensive changes to the Radiological Controls segment, Dr. Olson would also be required to complete the Radiological Controls Technician Qualification School in Portsmouth, VA. He accepted the position on the condition that the curriculum modernization efforts not interfere with his pursuit of a bachelor's degree from RPI. In order to prepare Dr. Olson and his team for the curriculum modernization effort, the U.S. Navy commissioned a technical training consulting firm to develop a custom certification program in educational psychology. The certification program was a combination of educational psychology fields to focus on curriculum planning, development, and learning outcomes in technical training while also incorporating e-Learning methodologies. During the modern curriculum development phase, Dr. Olson and his team were required to continue teaching the legacy curriculum to maintain talent pipeline throughput to maintain fleet readiness. For several years, Dr. Olson was in the unique position of teaching a legacy Navy Nuclear Program curriculum, developing a modern Navy Nuclear Program curriculum, and learning a nuclear engineering and engineering physics curriculum in the Navy-Malta Program simultaneously. Informed by his certification in educational psychology, Dr. Olson was able to compare various pedagogical approaches to develop his own personal pedagogy for efficient engineering education. Based on his experience in transitioning the U.S. submarine fleet from Cold War to Global War on Terror tactics, Dr. Olson was recruited by a small team of Industrial Researchers at GE in Schenectady, NY in 2007. The team mission was to disrupt the energy sector by developing innovative power generation technology to transition the company from legacy oil and gas revenue to a clean energy technology company. In order to understand how to develop technology for the purpose of maximizing customer value, he earned a master\u2019s degree that consisted of six power generation-centric engineering courses in power generation technology (wind, solar, gas turbine, design for manufacturing, semiconductors, and sustainability) plus five business courses. While working for GE, Dr. Olson was awarded multiple patents in several countries and developed many proprietary innovations to power generation technology, many of which significantly contributed to multiple Guinness World Records for Combined Cycle Power Plant Efficiency. In addition to technology advancements in thermal power systems, he pursued development of numerous nuclear power generation concepts but the absence of existing channels to market critically hindered progress. After shifting his focus to building channels to market for novel nuclear technology, he quickly realized that a dedicated effort to broadening the general knowledge of nuclear physics throughout the business unit would be needed before significant progress could be made. At that point, Dr. Olson began incorporating various aspects of his educational psychology background into his nuclear technology development activities. After numerous volunteer activities in local suburban and inner-city precollege environments, Dr. Olson developed a system of hands-on STEM exercises he believed would enable him to teach introductory nuclear physics to elementary students without the need for mathematics or prerequisite scientific knowledge. Over the course of several month, working with a local elementary teacher, he developed a series of learning modules that he would use to teach fourth and fifth graders nuclear and chemistry fundamentals. The learning session was successful beyond his greatest expectations and ultimately convinced him that is best option for positively impacting the energy sector was to publish his research in pursuit of a doctoral degree and pursue a career in academia.",

    "biography": "Jennifer Cardinal is a cultural anthropologist who studies community-led sustainable development and climate justice. Her ethnographic research extends a political ecology approach to questions about the precarious relationships, practices, and discourse at the intersection of community and sustainability. She teaches methodological and conceptual tools to understand local meanings and practices in the context of global systems. This attention to the local within the global frame includes a commitment to support inclusive sustainability initiatives. Jennifer\u2019s recent publications examine the relationship between consumption-driven migration, environmental conservation, agriculture, nonprofit organizations, and community development in small town on the southern Jalisco, Mexico coast. This stretch of coast is experiencing a transition as much of the beach-front land is being privatized for luxury resort development with claims of environmental sustainability. In the community Jennifer worked with, on the other hand, the concept of sustainability is materializing in an alternative locally-directed community development. This research explores how different environmental ideologies converge and produce frictions in divergent sustainable development practices. The local and international collaborative research projects Jennifer has designed in the US, Iceland, and the UK bring a commitment to inclusive community engagement that integrates teaching with research on human/environment relationships. At Earlham College in Richmond, Indiana, Jennifer\u2019s multidisciplinary student/faculty collaborative research team assessed local needs and assets, and designed an interactive resource guide in a project funded through the Earlham Center for Social Justice. Student researchers took the leading role in directing the project to ensure that it would be inclusive, accessible, and useful to community residents. This project built on research into local sustainability initiatives in the UK and using a model team members explored in London, resulted in a proposal to open a free Library of Things in collaboration with the municipal library in Richmond. Jennifer\u2019s current research interests in Troy, NY include care, community, precarity, and disaster. She is studying viable community networks for maneuvering climate insecurity with a focus on water and food. This local research also includes questions about how well-resourced institutions can better support local needs, and the role of community-engaged work and learning in building mutually supportive networks including transitory student populations and rooted community organizations. This local ethnographic research will build on a larger comparative project integrating research on grassroots sustainable development in sites in Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States.",

Her research and teaching focus on the development and use of mathematical models to guide decision making for logistics and supply chain challenges. Modern supply chain systems need to fulfill a wide variety of requests quickly with little warning in small units to many dispersed locations at low costs. These characteristics are fundamentally different than yesterday\u2019s demand that aggregated at given locations. In the face of this disconnect, her team's research thinks differently about how supply chain resources are acquired, managed, and allocated to fulfill customer requests. In doing so, her team's contributions span a diverse array of applications, including resource sharing platforms, peer-to-peer transportation systems, on-demand warehousing platforms, and crowdsourced order fulfillment systems, as well as facility logistics and transportation systems. Methodologically, they are modelers, whose core intellectual strength is in the development of mathematical and computational representations of sociotechnical systems and processes. Their research approach is to (1) create optimization models encompassing the primary system and decision trade-offs, (2) discover solution approaches and algorithms to efficiently solve the optimization models, (3) use the developed models and approaches to better understand the implications of the sociotechnical system\u2019s design and operation, and then (4) through theoretical results, computational experiments, and statistical analysis provide managerial insights and policy recommendations. Her team has created a wide range of operations research tools, including integer linear programs, bi-level optimization formulations, queuing models, and analytical models. Jen is a recipient of a National Science Foundation Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award, a Johnson & Johnson Women in STEM2D Scholars Award, a National Academies of Science Gulf Research Program Early-Career Fellowship, and a Young Investigator Award from the Office of Naval Research.

Specifically, I am interested in how lakes change relative to anthropogenic stressors including invasive species movement, eutrophication (nutrient enrichment), salinization and climate change. The majority of my research is conducted at Darrin Fresh Water Institute and focuses on Lake George and other Adirondack lakes. Select ongoing projects include: ARMOR - Advanced Response Model for Organism Removal Freshwater ecosystems are especially vulnerable to invasive species, which affect ecosystems and overall water quality. Many aquatic invasives are spread by boats moving between lakes. Thus, boat inspection and washing stations are an effective approach to remove invasives from boats before they enter a lake. At boat-washing stations across NYS, boats are subject to a surveys and inspections. Using these data, we developed a machine-learning model to predict invasives on arriving boats. We can correctly identify 96.5% of invasive arrivals. Identifying high-risk boats coupled with cleaning protocols will improve the effectiveness of detecting and mitigating new invasive introductions. Asian Clam Reproduction and Growth Asian clams are an invasive species that can disrupt lake ecosystems by altering nutrients and impacting native organisms. DFWI researchers first identified Asian clams in Lake George in 2010 and they are current studying clam reproduction and growth. To examine reproduction, clams are collected from three locations each week from (May-December). The clams are dissected and examined for juveniles. At these same locations, clam growth is examined by collecting ~200 clams and determining their length and width. This study will provide insight into the population dynamics of Asian clams, which will ultimately inform management techniques for controlling them.",

    "biography": "Giedt has worked on many topics in high energy physics: The confinement mechanism in quantum chromodynamics, using lattice gauge theory as a tool. In particular he was involved in the early studies of \"center dominance\" and Z(N) vortices. String compactifications in weakly coupled heterotic string theory. He worked on Z(3) orbifolds and computed the particle spectra and low energy phenomenology of these modes, after conducting systematic scans. This included work on CP violation, gauge coupling unification, moduli stabilization and neutrino masses. Supersymmetric lattice field theory. Here methods of reducing or eliminating fine-tuning were explored. He continues to work actively in this field and is conducting detailed studies of N=1 and N=4 super-Yang-Mills. For N=1 he is using domain wall fermions, and is currently working on obtaining the ground state spectrum. In the case of N=4, some fine-tuning must be performed even in the so-called \"twisted\" formulation, and he is studying this using Monte Carlo renormalization group techniques. Lattice technicolor theories were a focus of his research until the recent discovery of the Higgs boson, and subsequent results for its signal strengths to various final states disfavored composite Higgs models, as compared to models where the Higgs boson is an elementary scalar and decays according to the standard model in a natural way. However, he continues to work on studies of theories with an infrared fixed point, and is currently focused on corrections to scaling. The impact of lattice quantum chromodynamic studies on the search for dark matter. In particular, he showed how estimates of the direct detection cross section should be revised in light of lattice estimates of the strange quark sigma term. Scalar mesons in quantum chrmodynamics, especially the sigma particle. He has been developing efficient techniques for extracting its properties. Giedt also has a strong interest in high performance computing. He is one of the heaviest users of RPI's CCI computing facility. In addition he has been developing code to exploit graphics processing units (GPUs) for scientific computing since 2009. He was a contributor to the QUDA lattice quantum chromodynamics package, and has exploited this for studies of the sigma particle in recent work.",

John is particularly interested in hard problems that lie at the intersection of multiple disciplines. These problems are frequently characterized by complex, nonlinear, and imprecise models and multiple design objectives. John has drawn extensively on the passivity theory \u2013 an intuitive and powerful control design tool due to its natural connection to the Lyapunov method and its applicability to broad classes of dynamical systems. For performance and optimality, other system-theoretic tools are applied as needed, e.g., model identification, model reduction, multi-objective optimization, optimal control, image and signal processing. The numerous control applications that John has addressed broadly fit under motion, heat, and light, and their interactions. Motion research involves precision motion control (high speed scanning and motion planning in electronic manufacturing) and robotics (multi-robot cooperation, assistive robot, robotic satellite servicing, industrial robots in manufacturing). The focus for heat related research has been on thermo-fluid systems (two-phase heat transfer, vapor compression cycle, critical heat flux, thermal and flow instabilities) and building thermal management (temperature and humidity with human feedback and energy minimization). For light, the focus is in light-based circadian rhythm and sleep control (e.g., for shift workers, international and space travels, military personnel) and light field control using tunable light sources. In the intersection of motion and heat, John has studied thermal-compensation in precision motion systems, and more recently, thermo-mechanical processing of metal alloys (e.g., Ti6Al4V), combining modeling (Monte Carlo, Phase Field), imaging (SEM), and feedforward/feedback control. In the intersection of motion and light, his work has involved adaptive optics (in large field microscopy), beam steering (for laser electronic manufacturing), and blur-based estimation. In the intersection of heat and light, his interest is in the distributed building control, including both thermal and visual environments. The overarching theme that encompass all these applications is smart environment, including living environment, commercial environment, and manufacturing environment.",

Hart Professor, and Director of the Center for Infrastructure, Transportation, and the Environment; and the Volvo Research and Educational Foundations (VREF) Center of Excellence on Sustainable Urban Freight Systems at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He received his B.Sc. in Civil Engineering, Magna Cum Laude, from the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, in 1981; his M.Sc. from the Universidad Central de Venezuela in 1984; and his Ph.D. from The University of Texas at Austin in 1996. He has been a faculty at California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo, City College of New York (1997-2002), and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (2002-present). His work has received numerous awards, including the 2013 White House Champion of Change Award for his contributions to freight transportation and disaster response. His research emphasizes the integration, synthesis, and projection of the knowledge that exist in multiple disciplines to produce solutions to the complex and multifaceted problems\u2014which have proven to be too complex to be solved by single-disciplinary approaches\u2014that impact freight transportation and humanitarian logistics. His research taps into the knowledge of social sciences to build more realistic mathematical models of humanitarian logistics, and integrate cutting edge economic principles into freight transportation modeling, so that a complete picture could be developed on the broader impacts of transportation activity on the economy and the environment; and on the most effective ways to conduct post-disaster humanitarian logistics. His research blends field research and measurements, applied and basic research to ensure that theory relates to reality; and, ultimately, to a set of actionable policy recommendations that contribute to the betterment of the economy and society. Current research activities focus on three major areas: freight transportation demand modeling, sustainable freight policy, and humanitarian logistics. His work on freight demand modeling focuses on enhancing the realism of spatial price equilibrium (SPE) models, and development of simplified modeling techniques. His work on sustainable freight policy studies the interactions between the agents (e.g., shippers, carriers, receivers) involved in freight activity, to define ways to exploit these interactions to foster sustainable development and operations. An important third area, of profound human impact, focuses on the development of novel forms of humanitarian logistics. His research group has pioneered the multidisciplinary study of post-disaster humanitarian logistic operations. His research has: identified the key lessons learned from the response to the largest disasters of recent times; translated these lessons into actionable policy recommendations; and shared these suggestions with disaster response agencies. As part of the field work, his research group has conducted detailed analyses of the most prominent disasters of recent times, including: Hurricane Katrina, the Port-au-Prince earthquake, the tornadoes in Joplin and Alabama, Hurricane Irene, and the Tohoku disasters in Japan. His contributions to the solution of regional and national problems are numerous as they span modeling, policy, and research. In particular, his ability to transition research into practice\u2014navigating complex implementation environments\u2014has been recognized with appointments to prestigious positions. As a member of the Board of the New York State Thruway Authority\u2014as the only researcher and Hispanic American in the board\u2019s history\u2014he helps oversee toll policy and the replacement of the $4 billion Tappan Zee Bridge, one of the largest construction projects in the US. He is overseeing all-electronic-toll-collection, toll setting, financing, asset management, and helps the agency reach a higher level of efficiency. His policy contributions also cover disaster response; as a member of the National Academy of Sciences\u2019 Disaster Research Roundtable, he advises the federal government in disaster response on the basis of his field research after large disasters and catastrophic events. He has been member of numerous panels for the National Academy of Sciences\u2019 Transportation Research Board, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and other agencies. His research, routinely implemented by practitioners, has been impactful. His work on freight generation and freight trip generation has led to the development of freight trip generation models\u2014to be incorporated in the next edition of the ITE Trip Generation Manual\u2014that are more accurate than any currently available. Equally transformative has been his research on freight tour models, freight origin-destination estimation, and others that are being incorporated into transportation modeling packages such as TRANSCAD, TRANUS, among others. One of his most visible contributions is the NYC off-hour-delivery project, which is having a transformative effect on urban freight policy. This project has blossomed into a potent freight demand management tool that has won the enthusiastic support of the private sector. It is estimated to lead to economic savings of 100-200/million dollars per year, and reductions of: 202.7 metric tons (t)/year of CO, 40t/year of HC, 11.8t/year of NOx, and 69.9 kg/year of PM10). Recognizing these significant impacts, the City of New York adopted OHD as part of its sustainability plan, and the Federal Highway Administration created a program to foster OHD, based on the one pioneered in NYC, and to replicate it in other US cities. Because of its impacts, TIME magazine identified off-hour deliveries as one of the \u201c10 Ideas that Make a Difference\u201d in traffic congestion. His leadership positions include: President of the Scientific Committee of the Pan-American Conferences of Traffic and Transportation Engineering, member of the Scientific Committee of the World Conference of Transport Research, Elected Member of the Council for the Association for European Transport, member of the International Organizing Committee of the City Logistics Conferences, member of technical committees at numerous professional organizations, and member of the editorial boards of the leading journals. He has led dozens of technical sessions, and has participated in numerous technical committees at the Transportation Research Board (e.g., Intermodal Freight, Urban Freight, Freight Economics, Freight Planning and Logistics, Road Pricing, Task Force of Freight Demand Modeling), European Transport Conference, World Conference of Transport Research, Pan-American Conference of Transport and Traffic Engineering, and others. He is a member of a number of high level public sector committees and boards. His current appointments include: United States Department of Transportation\u2019s National Freight Advisory Committee (2013-2015), Board of the New York State Thruway Authority (2010-present), National Academy of Sciences\u2019 Disaster Research Roundtable, National Academy of Sciences\u2019 Committee for Review of USDOT Truck Size and Weight Study (2013-2014), Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s Core Group on Community Engagement (June 2011-present), Advisory Panel for the NY-NJ-CT-PA Regional Catastrophic Planning Group (March 2010-2013), and Advisory Panel of the Mohawk Corridor Multimodal Transportation Study (2010-2012). The list of awards he has received includes: the 2013 White House Champion of Change Award, CAREER Award from the National Science Foundation (2001-2006); the Milton Pikarsky Memorial Award in 1996, from the Council on University Transportation Centers, the Salute to the Scholars Award from the City University of New York (in 2000 and 2001); the 2006 Robert E. Kerker Research Award in recognition of Excellence in Research of Special Importance to Practitioners and Scholars of Public Administration and Policy in New York State; the 2007 School of Engineering Research Award; and a Proclamation from the Council of the City of New York (2001). He is a fellow of: State Academy of Public Administration (2006), International Road Federation (1991), Japanese International Cooperation Agency (1989), and the Organization of American States (1982-1984). According to Google Scholar, he is the most widely published and cited freight researcher in the world.

    "biography": "June Deery works in Media Studies and writes on commercialization, politics, gender, race/ ethnicity, class, and Reality TV. For some time, she has been investigating cultural perceptions of fact and fiction and is currently exploring their status within a political context. In Consuming Reality: The Commercialization of Factual Entertainment (Palgrave Macmillan, 2012), she demonstrates how reality television monetizes and consumes reality through its branding of content and propagation of capitalist narratives. Among other things, she examines the professionalization of individual identities and social relationships and the commodification of viewers and TV participants. Reality TV (Polity, 2014) provides an overview of the impact of reality television since its inception and its contribution to discussions of gender, class, race, celebrity, audience agency, and consumer identity. The book also continues to explore cultural understandings of factuality and realism. She co-edited (with Andrea Press) and contributed to Media and Class: TV, Film, and Digital Culture (Routledge, 2017). In this collection, a range of prominent British and American scholars address topics such as class as entertainment, labor relations and media production, and digital celebrity. Recent articles have appeared in Critical Studies in Media Communication, Popular Communication, as well as essay collections. Deery has received awards for best journal article, best conference paper, and for teaching. In 2010, she was the recipient of Rensselaer\u2019s Trustee\u2019s Outstanding Teacher Award and before that the School of the Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences Teaching Award (2009).",

Dr. Rogers completed her PhD in Earth and Planetary Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis, with previous degrees awarded from Stanford University (M.S. 2001) and Harvard University (A.B. 1996). Dr. Rogers is a member of the New York Center for Astrobiology (NYCA) and the Institute for Data Exploration and Applications (IDEA). Dr. Rogers\u2019 research focuses on the relationships between microbial communities and environmental conditions in extreme ecosystems, and is broadly applied to understanding the nature of the origin of life on Earth, the potential for life throughout the solar system, and the extent of life in modern extreme environments. To advance our understanding of environmental microbiomes in these systems, Dr. Rogers research program includes field research in early Earth and Mars analog environments as well as laboratory experimental studies of microbial behavior under extreme conditions. Additionally, the group is exploring the viability of abiotic synthesis of biomolecules over a range of early Earth conditions. The driving question in this research is how realistic environmental conditions combine to form habitable niches that can both support the early emergence of life as well as the long-term survival of life in these environments. Dr. Rogers\u2019 fieldwork includes several terrestrial hydrothermal systems including Cerro Negro Volcano, Nicaragua, the Vulcano shallow marine hydrothermal system in Italy, and several modern deep-sea mid-ocean ridge environments. These field endeavors are combined with extensive laboratory analytical and experimental techniques to develop a holistic picture of functional microbial ecosystems. More specifically, laboratory techniques include cultivation of extremophiles under high pressure, high temperature, acidic, and anaerobic conditions; a next-generation genomics approach to determine the functional environmental microbiome in extreme systems; geochemical analyses and modeling of environmental and bioenergetics parameters; and the synthesis of these datasets using novel data analytics. Dr. Rogers\u2019 research program currently includes two postdoctoral associates, four graduate students (in both Earth & Environmental Sciences and the Department of Biological Sciences), and several undergraduate researchers. The laboratory is housed in Jonsson-Rowland Science Center and includes a state of the art high-pressure microbial cultivation facility. Additionally, Dr. Rogers is the US Lead for the Deep Carbon Observatory\u2019s (Sloan Foundation) High Pressure Sampling, Transport, and Cultivation User Facility and the co-chair of the UNOLS Deep Submergence Science Committee New User Program.

In the last ten years she has become interested in working with living systems, animals and art, considering the social, political and ethical dilemmas of biotechnology and surrounding industries. Her most recent art works include a video documentary about green or natural burials, entitled Death Down Under; and a performance/visual arts project called Blood Wars that uses white blood cells to test an individual\u2019s strengths (see http://vampirestudygroup.com/bloodwars/ ). These projects have allowed High to investigate areas such as decomposition and the immune system. High is also a scholar of the history of video technologies, systems and video art, and has a background in both writing and publishing (see e-felix.org for reference to a video art journal, FELIX, founded and edited by High in 1990s-2003). Her co-edited book The Emergence of Video Processing Tools: Television Becoming Unglued, with Sherry Miller Hocking of the Experimental Television Center, and Mona Jimenez of the Moving Image Preservation Program at NYU, on the history of video imaging tools will be published by Intellect Books (UK) in 2013. This text is the culmination of seven years of research into the histories of video imaging tool production in the USA. The book presents stories of the development of early video tools and systems designed and built by artists and technologists during the late 1960s and 70s, and how that history of collaborations among inventors, designers and artists has affected contemporary tool-makers. \u201cI\u2019m interested in notions of neo-dead - not really living, not really dead: The idea about immortality and the quest for immortality that I think drives a lot of scientific research,\u201d High said. \u201cVampire Study Group projects specifically look at the body, the biological manipulation of life, and present a dystopic view of the future of the human species. In cultural history vampires play on erotic fantasies and fears. Currently there is a surge of interest in the vampire myth seen in popular media with such television series as True Blood, and movies such as Twilight and Let the Right One In.

These could be employed to mitigate the spread of this viral pathogen. Lastly, we've devised a method to create dual-use DNA nanostructures that can function as a diagnostic tool for or inhibit viral pathogens. b) Drug Toxicity: We are particularly interested in studying the effects of orally administered pharmaceuticals on major organs in the body, as well as the gut microbiota. Accordingly, we have been leveraging available in vitro data related to the biochemical functions of pharmaceuticals across chemical and therapeutic classes to develop predictive models of organ toxicity. Another area of interest is investigating the influence of these pharmaceuticals on microbial function and distribution within the gut microbiota, and how it affects overall health. c) Single Cell Transcriptomics: Given the wealth of publicly available single cell RNA-seq data, we are concentrating our efforts on utilizing these resources to develop methods that improve our understanding of disease etiology. We are currently investigating diseases such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and SARS-CoV2 infections. In order to aid the broader scientific community, we have developed a web app that enhances data exploration and facilitates hypothesis generation.",

Instead it is a broad and encompassing field involving many different disciplines and areas of research. A good description can be found through the University of Washington [ link ]: \u201cAstrobiology is the study of life in the universe. The search for life beyond the Earth requires an understanding of life, and the nature of the environments that support it, as well as planetary, planetary system and stellar interactions and processes. To provide this understanding, astrobiology combines the knowledge and techniques from many fields, including astronomy, biology, chemistry, geology, atmospheric science, oceanography and aeronautical engineering.\u201d Where the Johnson-Finn (PENGUIN) Group Fits in Astrobiology Research: Chemists, astronomers, and geologists at RPI follow a history of research in astrobiology and pre-biotic chemistry (the field of research exploring the types of chemistry that could have existed before life emerged). Science itself is an ever-evolving organism, adapting to new information, new techniques, and new problems in need of solutions. Currently, the newest evolution of astrobiology research at RPI is through RARE (Rensselaer Astrobiology & Research Education) Center. A collaboration between the departments of Earth & Environmental Science and Chemistry & Chemical Biology funded by NASA and RPI. Professor Johnson-Finn is a faculty member of the RARE Center and a Co-I of a NASA funded research grant involving collaborators across the country titled \"Earth First Origins\" (EFO). The EFO focuses on understanding the connection between geologic environments and the emergence of life through observations, modelling, and experiments. Link to RARE flyer Sitting at the junction of organic chemistry and geology, the Johnson-Finn group aims to answer relevant questions as to the roles that geology plays in the pathways of organic compounds through experiments. When the astrobiology community was asked in recent years to define goals and objectives for future research, \"Identifying abiotic sources of organic compounds\" and \"Synthesis and function of macromolecules in the origin of life\" topped the list. [ NASA Astrobiology ] The Johnson-Finn research group is focused on exploring the fundamental chemistry that is available to organic compounds in geologic settings, primarily the role that minerals (the simplest chemical component of rocks) play either as catalyst or reagent in aqueous organic reactions. Through a combination of hydrothermal experiments, electrochemical approaches, and thermodynamic modelling, reaction pathways for different classes of organic compounds can be traced in the formation of a larger organic chemical framework. Beyond Astrobiology / Exploring Problems on Earth Our laboratory is looking to pursue research questions beyond our astrobiology work, probing fundamental abiotic processes that exist anywhere in the universe or pivoting back to Earth to find solutions related to the larger environmental issues we face today. The fundamental approach provides a powerful starting position to comprehend and explore how different environments evolve at a molecular level. Students help to guide these questions and drive our understanding forward! Techniques of the Laboratory (Both Physical and Virtual) The PENGUIN laboratories (currently under renovation) will house experimental vessels that can explore different fundamental parameters related to aqueous organic reactions. The goal of all studies in this group will be to gather information about the kinetics and mechanisms of different organic reaction paths through either experimental or theoretical means. The combination of experimental expertise with theoretical guidance is most powerful. The three main approaches utilized in the group include (1) hydrothermal chemistry, (2) electrochemistry, and (3) thermodynamic modelling. Interested students will undertake projects using one or more of these techniques to pursue questions related to specific geologic, environmental, or experimental fields of study. Hydrothermal chemistry: Water that is hot (described as \"hydrothermal\") has different properties from the water that we observe at ambient conditions. The reaction paths for organic compounds, especially in contact with different mineral surfaces available in naturally occurring geologic settings, is in need of detailed chemical cartographers, looking to map these environments through experiment. To perform such experiments requires the use of high temperature and high pressure reaction vessels and experimental methods designed to withstand such conditions while keeping the reaction mixture intact. Electrochemistry: To observe redox reactions requires the ability to control and monitor the flow of electrons. Electrochemistry is a useful tool for exploring reactions that require the transfer of those electrons to proceed. Initial inspirations for this work involve the use of semiconductor minerals as catalytic drivers of organic redox reactions. How those reactions may occur at hydrothermal conditions, influence the available biosignatures observed on other planets, or be harnesses for the purpose of sustainable chemistry are all of interest and under pursuit by researchers in this group. Thermodynamic Calculations: The analytical chemist Izaak M. Kolthoff popularized the maxim inherited from his PhD advisor N. Schoorl: \"Theory guides; experiment decides.\" Thermodynamic tools such as CHNOSZ https://chnosz.net/ can help to guide different experimental and analytical research by providing insight into what might exist and what definitely does not exist from an energetics perspective. Involving programming, data management, and database building, these calculations serve as a solid foundation upon which experimental studied can thrive and expand. Laboratory facilities will be located in the 1st floor of the Cogswell Laboratory building.",

    "research": "In the Ligon lab, we are interested in how cells function in the three-dimensional world. We study the internal structure of the cell, the cytoskeleton, and how it is organized to generate and maintain the complex 3D shape of differentiated cells. We also study how cells interact with their environment, in particular how cancer cells interact with the tissue surrounding the tumor, also known as the tumor microenvironment. We use a combination of live-cell imaging and other cell biological, biochemical and molecular techniques to examine cell structure, dynamics and function in the context of the living cell. Some cells, such as those of the nervous system, have elaborate three-dimensional shapes that are essential to their specialized activities. We study the microtubule cytoskeleton, a complex network of protein polymers that are essential to establish and maintain cell structure. Microtubules have several functions in the cell: they are mechanical and structural elements; they serve as tracks for long-distance movements of organelles and other cargoes; and they can play a direct role in biochemical signaling cascades. We are investigating how certain sub-populations of microtubules are biochemically specialized for specific cellular functions by a combination of sub-cellular location, post-translational modifications, and interactions with other proteins. We are also investigating the role of the tumor microenvironment in the metastatic progression of cancer cells. Both the cells and the non-cellular elements of the tissue surrounding a tumor can play a significant role in whether or not a tumor cell will become invasive. We are using the tools of cell biology and biochemistry, as well as novel biomimetic materials, to explore the role of abnormal cell-cell interactions and cell-matrix interactions in a breast cancer model system.",

    "biography": "My research interests are time dependent. The reason is that I like mathematics, and I like to use mathematics to understand the world we live in (i.e., I am an applied mathematician). Here are two specific research topics of current interest: 1) Mechanoreception. This is the study of how a living organism senses and then recognizes mechanical stimuli. The mechanoreceptors that I am presently working on are in the auditory system and in skin. For example, the mechanisms through which skin transduces tactile stimuli from a mechanical to neural signal are not understood. Therefore, the goal of my research is to construct a mathematical model that describes this process. This project involves the study of the nonlinear deformation of skin, the analysis of the dynamics of the tactile receptor, and the study of the nonlinear diffusion associated with the electro-chemical processes in the nerve. 2) Sleep-Wake Cycle. The goal of this research project is to derive, and then analyze, a physiologically based model of the human sleep-wake cycle. The approach is to use the known properties of the neurotransmitters associated with wake and sleep, and the regions of the brain in which they function, to derive the model. This approach also incorporates, or accounts for, the states of sleep (REM and NREM) and the mechanisms that regulate it (homeostatic drive and circadian synchronization).

    "research": "Nearly every aspect of neuronal function depends on the accurate transport of membrane proteins to axons or dendrites. Axons conduct electrochemical action potentials and primarily send signals, whereas dendrites primarily receive signals. Because these two domains have distinctly different functions, they each require a specific complement of membrane proteins. These proteins are delivered to their cargo by vesicle transport. Vesicle carriers that contain axonal proteins are transported to the axon; vesicle carriers that contain dendritic proteins are transported to dendrites and excluded from the axon. This phenomenon of directed vesicle movement to dendrites or the axon is referred to as selective transport. Understanding the molecular regulation of vesicle transport is a fundamental problem in neuroscience and cell biology and defects in vesicle transport are thought to underlie the axonal degeneration characteristic of many neurodegenerative diseases. Intracellular carriers are moved by motor proteins that generate locomotive force. One family of motor proteins are kinesins. Our long-term goal is to determine the molecular regulation of kinesin motors and understand how they confer specific transport behaviors to vesicles that move cargoes to axons and dendrites. Our lab uses a variety of cell biological approaches to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie intracellular vesicle transport. Primarily, we apply live-cell fluorescent microscopy to track and measure individual vesicle carriers as they move inside cells. Our experiments also rely heavily on molecular biology, biochemistry, and tissue culture techniques.",

    "biography": "Mary Anne Staniszewski investigates culture, art, and media in relation to political and social perspectives. \"I investigate the way we 'invent' things in our cultures, how concepts and institutions emerge, such as art, exhibitions, and race. Framing such entities historically can reveal how we create not only our cultures, but also our sense of ourselves. This perspective has political implications. By making visible the historical limitations of social conventions and disciplinary discourses, my intention is to demonstrate how cultures can be changed and transformed.\" Staniszewski's major research and writing projects form a \"trilogy\" of interdisciplinary investigations of modern art and culture as articulations of the modern self. Staniszewski is completing a book on the third area of analysis, which deals with issues of race and slavery. The first book, Believing Is Seeing: Creating the Culture of Art (Penguin USA, 1995; Korean version translated as \"This Is Not Art,\" introduction and Translator, Yiso Bahc, Seoul: Hyunsil Cultural Studies, Hyun Sil Moon Hwayonju, 2000 and 2007) frames art as we know it--that is art for art's sake--as an \"invention\" of the modern era and a manifestation of the age of the individual and the liberal, democratic, capitalist state. In the second book, The Power of Display: A History of Exhibition Installations at the Museum of Modern Art (MIT Press, 1998; Korean translation: \"Preface: The Power of Display 2006,\" Translator, Kim Sang-kyu et al., Seoul: designLocus, 2007), installations are analyzed as sites for collective rituals that enhance particular notions of subjecthood--in MoMA's case, a U.S. liberal, democratic, capitalist one. Staniszewski has overseen a number of publications and projects related to the New York City cultural center, Exit Art, which closed in June 2012. She has co-edited with Lauren Rosati the exhibition catalogue, Alternative Histories: New York Art Spaces, 1960-2010 (Exit Art and MIT Press, 2012) and conceived the symposium, Contemporary Slavery, which she organized in collaboration with Exit Art's staff, held on June, 11, 2011 and which was produced in conjunction with Exit Art's 2011 Contemporary Slavery exhibition. Staniszewski was the Director of Exit Art's Curatorial Incubator and was Executive Editor of the curatorial program's catalogue, Signs of Change: Social Movement Cultures 1960s to Now, Editors/Curators, Dara Greenwald and Josh MacPhee (Exit Art and AK Press, 2010).",

    "research": "Matthew Wolf-Meyer's work focuses on medicine, science, and media in the United States, and draws on history, contemporary experiences, and popular representations of health and illness. Across his research, he focuses on how personhood and subjectivity are produced and transformed over the life course. This includes concerns about how the care of children and the elderly reflect cultural expectations of what it means to be normal, how the structure of families and other institutions reflect social concerns, and how attention to experiences of disability and illness can help build more inclusive societies. His first book, The Slumbering Masses: Sleep, Medicine, and Modern American Life (2012), is the first book-length social scientific study of sleep in the United States, and offers insight into the complex lived realities of disorderly sleepers, the long history of sleep science, and the global impacts of the exportation of American sleep. His second book, Theory for the World to Come: Speculative Fiction and Apocalyptic Anthropology (2019), is an autoethnographic exploration of speculative fiction as a source of social theory in the context of global and local catastrophes. Building on contemporary debates about the Anthropocene, Theory for the World to Come addresses the shortfalls in imagining livable futures and engages with critical race theory and indigenous futures to articulate an inclusive politics of the future. Unraveling: Remaking Personhood in a Neurodiverse Age (2020), builds an alternative history of American neuroscience and psychiatry through an engagement with disability memoirs of neurological disorder and the capacities that memoirists see as vital to an inclusive, anti-ableist politics. Unraveling pairs ethnographic research with psy-experts (neuroscientists, psychiatrists, psychoanalysis) with textual and historiographic analysis of a diverse set of popular and scientific writers. It forwards a theory of affective bioethics \u2014 drawing on feminist materialist philosophy \u2014 as the basis of a posthuman politics of care. In 2001, along with Davin Heckman, Wolf-Meyer was one of the founding editors of reconstruction: studies in contemporary culture, one of the first Open Access journals. Wolf-Meyer is also a contributing editor to Somatosphere.",

In particular, her research concentrates on computer-aided interactive narratives, embodied conversational agents and pervasive user interface, elements that make virtual environments more engaging and effective. Si has been using her research to develop virtual environments and intelligent conversational agents for serious games. In one example of her work, Si helped to develop the Tactical Language Training System, a large-scale (six to twelve scenes each for three languages) award-winning project funded by the U.S. military for rapid language and culture training. The system has been used by thousands of military personnel. \u201cComputer-aided interactive narrative is a new form of media that allows the user to play a role in a story and interact with other characters controlled by an automated system. The user\u2019s choices of actions affect the development of the story,\u201d said Si. Narrative itself is a central part of the human experience. Its power to shape people's minds and affect people's behavior has been recognized throughout recorded history. The support for user interactivity distinguishes interactive narrative from other narrative forms. By allowing the user to interact, the experience is richer and potentially more engaging. Moreover, interactivity can promote intrinsic motivation in learning, and support learning in context and replay. Therefore, interactive narrative can be potentially a more effective media than traditional narrative.\u201d Si regularly presents and publishes her work. She has recently presented on \u201cActivating Narcissus: Cognitive and Affective Systems Transformed Through \"Serious\" Game Play\u201d at the International Conference on the Philosophy of Computer Games; \u201cForeign language learning in immersive virtual environments\u201d at the IS&T/SPIE Electronic Imaging conference, and \u201cModeling Rich Characters in Interactive Narrative Games\u201d and GAMEON-ASIA.

This receptor is highly expressed in the human brain, with the highest expression levels known to be in the hippocampus, frontal cortex, and neurovasculature. The receptor\u2019s physiological role is largely unknown, but it likely plays significant roles in serotonin's actions in the CNS and the actions of various serotonergic drugs. With its high expression level in the hippocampus, particularly in the dentate gyrus, there is a strong possibility the 5-HT1E receptor is involved in memory. And considering the neuroprotective effects of 5-HT1E signaling in cultured human neurons, this receptor is a promising druggable target for therapies aimed at correcting memory deficits, like those associated with Alzheimer\u2019s Disease. Dr. Klein has contributed significantly to the literature investigating the pharmacology of this receptor and its distribution in the mammalian brain.

Dr. Klein encourages students to explore a wide range of research topics including cancer biology, stem cell biology, neuroscience, pharmacology, and immunology. Students develop an independent project during the first half of the semester wherein they write a formal research proposal, refine their experimental design, and establish appropriate protocols. In the second half of the semester, students carry out the research they proposed using the advanced tools at their disposal in the Science Center. At the end of the semester, students present their findings in a formal presentation to the class and write a publication-quality manuscript. BIOL 2120 & BIOL 2125 - Introduction to Cell and Molecular Biology lecture (spring) & lab (fall & spring) This is an introductory course in cell structure and function. It is intended for Biology and Biomedical Engineering majors, and covers such topics as chemical composition of cells, molecular structure and function of organelles, membrane transport, DNA replication, gene transcription and translation, and the basic biochemistry underlying cellular behavior including cancer cell biology. The lab provides hand-on experience with standard techniques and equipment used in biochemistry and molecular biology. Bright-field, phase-contrast, and fluorescence microscopy are employed to study cellular processes and gene expression in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. BIOL 1960 - Biology in Popular Fiction (summer) This course is intended for all majors and examines how biology and biotechnology are represented in popular fiction across multiple types of media. Several themes are explored, including genetic engineering, human genome modification, cloning, eugenics, restorative medicine, enhancement/augmentation of the human body, xenografts, synthetic organ transplants, and pandemic disease. A central goal of this course is to familiarize students with the latest technologies and science applicable to these themes. Students explore the future potential of today\u2019s technologies, identify obstacles preventing works of fiction from becoming reality, and propose potential paths to overcome these obstacles. To this end, students learn how to investigate scientific literature and formulate hypotheses; they become familiar with peer-reviewed scientific journals and other tools used by scientists to communicate their findings.",

Research on both these topics is on-going at Rensselaer. This includes an analytical evaluation of the relationship between seismic damage (repairs per kilometer of pipe) and ground strain, as well as numerical and centrifuge evaluation of buried pipe subject to abrupt PGD at a fault crossing or the margin of a lateral spread. The 1999 MCEER Monograph by O\u2019Rourke and Liu entitled \u201cResponse of Buried Pipeline Subject to Earthquake Effects\u201dprovide background information and a summary for the topic. An updated Buried Pipeline Monograph is expected early in 2011. Snow Loading on Roofs: * Ground Snow Loads * Drift loads on stepped roofs * Drift loads on gable roofs * Eave icing Snow and Ice Loads on Buildings: Snow loading is a structural design consideration for roofs in most states and the controlling load for at least some structural component in about half the states. Although not a significant load from a structural standpoint ice dams frequently lead to infiltration and costly water damage to interior walls and ceiling surfaces. Research on both issues is ongoing at Rensselaer. Of the many types of snow loads; uniform, sliding snow from a higher roof, etc drifted snow results in higher loads and more potential for structural damage. The Rensselaer water flume is being used to simulate snow drift loading and establish relationships for use in national codes. A guide explaining the ASCE 7-10 snow load provision through design examples and frequently asked questions has been published by ASCE Press.",

In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, harnessing the power of data at the edge of the network has emerged as a pivotal catalyst for unlocking the true potential of collective intelligence. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the wealth of information generated at the periphery of our networks holds the key to a new era of innovation and insight. By tapping into this decentralized data wealth, we not only empower individuals and devices with real-time decision-making capabilities but also foster a collaborative environment where a multitude of perspectives converge to form a unified intelligence. This collective intelligence transcends traditional boundaries, enabling us to tackle complex challenges with unprecedented efficiency and creativity. Embracing the untapped potential of data at the edge is not just a technological advancement; it's a strategic imperative that drives us towards a future where our connected world thrives on the synergy of decentralized insights, propelling us to reach heights we never thought possible.

Tailoring machine learning algorithms to exploit this massive amount of data can lead to many new applications and open-up new markets in medical care, finance, and enabling ambient intelligence. Due to the privacy concerns and the growing storage and computational capabilities of edge devices, it is increasingly attractive to store and process the data locally by shifting network computations to the edge. This enables decentralized intelligence where local computations on the data converts decentralized data to a global intelligence; hence, enhancing data privacy while learning from the collection of data.

Dr. Zeghal\u2019s research focuses on three areas that are central to the national effort to reduce the impact of these hazards: (1) multiscale modeling of geosystems, (2) model validation and calibration, and (3) development of improved optimal design tools. The methodology of evaluating and predicting the performance of geosystems is undergoing a significant paradigm shift. Computational simulations are destined to become more prominent than empirical approaches and will ultimately become the main tool for analysis and design of civil systems. A hierarchy of adaptive and cost-effective computational models capable of accurately predicting the multiscale and multiphysics response of geosystems is being developed. This hierarchy enables a seamless handling of the initiation and evolution of the various response and failure mechanisms of soils under extreme loading conditions. The hierarchical models range from homogenized continuum to discontinuous coarse-particle formulations. A class of innovative system identification and inverse problem tools are being developed to calibrate these models using experimental data ranging from soil sample and centrifuge tests to full-scale and field tests. This new generation of computational procedures is being translated to practice through careful interactions with practitioners (from industry and government laboratories) and the introduction of changes in the educational curricula of our students.",

    "biography": "Following an early career in industry as a Sr. research scientist working in the fields of ultrafast lasers, optical communications, and materials processing, I joined the Center for Ultrafast Optical Sciences (CUOS) to explore light transmission through highly scattering media through light manipulation or wavefront shaping. This newly emerging field of optical wavefront shaping involves the ability to manipulate light fields both spatially and temporally. It has largely been enabled by the availability of spatial light modulators (SLM). SLMs are used to create arbitrarily complex light fields that are now powerful elements of the optics toolbox. An SLM also provides means to manipulate the fundamental constituents of classical light or single photons, which obey the laws of quantum physics. In my research, i will be using these new tools to explore novel ways to address topics where conventional optical techniques are hard to apply, such as the control of light propagation in biological tissues, complex photonic structures, plasmonic systems, and multimode fibers. My research ( https://ngomresearch.com/ ) will also directly address the core problem of entanglement degradation by developing methods to create and manipulate entangled light fields carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) and related structured light fields. The light fields are manipulated using wavefront shaping techniques in waveguide e.g. multimode fibers in order to overcome environment induced destruction of coherence.",

She is a historian of science, technology, and medicine who focuses on legal and illegal drugs, drug science, policy, and treatment, harm reduction, and gender and addiction. Her most recent book is OD: Naloxone and the Politics of Overdose (MIT Press, 2020). \u201cHow have ideas about drugs and drug addiction changed over time? What do we know about drug addiction, and how do we know it? Why do we have the drug policies that we do?\u201d said Campbell. \u201cWe consider some drugs to cause social problems, and others to solve them. Often we are talking about the same molecules\u2014the differences lie in who uses them and how they do so. My research centers on scientific communities who make knowledge about drugs, and interactions between scientists, treatment providers, policymakers, patient advocates\u2014and drug users themselves.\u201d Campbell also studies the ethics of human subjects research; social movements; and the fruitful convergence between neuroscience and addiction research. She has published two books on gender: Gendering Addiction: The Politics of Drug Treatment in a Neurochemical World with Elizabeth Ettorre (Palgrave, 2011) and her first book, Using Women: Gender, Drug Policy, and Social Justice (Routledge, 2000), which was about how drug-using women figured in drug policy discourse from the 1910s to the 1990s. Campbell and co-authors JP Olsen and Luke Walden published a visual history of the federal drug treatment hospital in Lexington, Kentucky, titled The Narcotic Farm: The Rise and Fall of America\u2019s First Prison for Drug Addicts (Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 2008). Campbell also appeared in Olsen and Walden\u2019s 2007 documentary, The Narcotic Farm, and she often speaks on radio shows about the relevance of this project to current drug treatment. Campbell\u2019s scholarly book on the history of the formative science conducted by the laboratory at The Narcotic Farm, which was called the Addiction Research Center and is now the intramural research program of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, is titled Discovering Addiction: The Science and Politics of Substance Abuse Research (University of Michigan Press, 2007). With Joseph Spillane she created the Oral History of Substance Abuse Research Project, funded by the National Science Foundation, the College on Problems of Drug Dependence, and the University of Michigan Substance Abuse Research Center. In 2009 she received the Media Award from the College on Problems of Drug Dependence for her work on the history of the science of addiction research and treatment.",

    "biography": "Nishtha Langer is an Associate Professor of Business Analytics (with tenure) at the Lally School of Management, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. She also holds a joint appointment as the Associate Professor of Economics at the School of Humanities and Social Sciences at RPI. She teaches graduate and undergraduate students on aligning the firms' Information Technology (IT) strategy and business strategies for sustained competitive advantage, exploring new markets, and enabling grounded management and economic principles through the use of IT and Business Analytics. IT\u2019s organizational and societal impact is multi-disciplinary and wide ranging. Dr. Langer is deeply influenced by the inter-disciplinary research ethic of Herb Simon in \"following the problem\" in analyzing the value of key IT investments and resources. Her research benefits from her rigorous academic training at Carnegie Mellon University combined with over 5 years of IT experience in India and USA. Using theory and techniques from different disciplines such as economics, operations management, marketing, analytics, and organizational behavior, she is interested in empirically analyzing how firms can use their IT capital and IT human capital most effectively. More recently, her research examines the biases in IT labor markets and the societal and business value of social media platforms such as Twitter. Dr. Langer's research has been forthcoming or published at top tier journals, including Management Science, Information Systems Research (ISR), MIS Quarterly, and Journal of Management Information Systems, amongst others, and widely presented and acclaimed by both academic and industry audience. Her recent publication examining gender and promotions in the IT industry has been featured on INFORMS' Resoundingly Human podcast and elsewhere. This study was awarded a Best Publication of 2020 by the Senior Scholars Consortium, Association of Information Systems at the International Conference on Information Systems, 2021.

    "primary-area": "IT Human Capital",
    "research": "Many years ago, I had a chance to work on a tax project with one of the state governments in India. The client's project team showed an immense faith in the power of information technologies (IT) and how it could change things - for instance, the sordid corruption that plagues the Indian bureaucracy. That experience forever changed my perception of IT. I am a believer! Now it is up to people like me to measure what IT does.* The global tech industry was estimated to be $ 3.2 trillion in 2019. As IT and business analytics become more integral to organizations, their effective management and use of emerges as a critical issue. My long term research agenda is focused on understanding how organizations derive value from these IT resources. I have published 9 journal articles and presented my research over 50 times at top tier conferences and at invited presentations. My research has been nominated for and won best paper awards and has been well cited. My research interests are motivated by real world problems and questions arising from management of technology practice at firms. Digitization drives unprecedented growth, connection, and productivity gains. Yet, there is only an imperfect understanding of the value of key IT resources \u2013 IT labor (human capital) as well as IT capital (process and technology) or how the value of organizational investments towards these key resources is realized. I believe these questions are significant not only to the academia but also to practice. I think I betray my Carnegie Mellon roots when I say that I am inspired by Herb Simon to \" follow the problem,\" using interdisciplinary theories and techniques. That said, my research currently follows two broad themes that represent a rich and growing field in which new and old economic, behavioral, and organizational theories and frameworks can be tested and perfected: IT Human Capital Call it the wisdom of old age, but I wholeheartedly believe that human capital is the biggest asset of the knowledge economy. First, as more complex and strategic IT capabilities are increasingly being sourced across organizational and geographic boundaries, I examine the role of practical intelligence in delivering these capabilities. Second, the rapid pace of technological change necessitates a constant learning curve for IT workers, where not only the task but also the context of IT work is changing in fundamental ways; I am primarily interested in understanding mechanisms such as training and peer effects through which human capital is created and how these mechanisms realize productivity and organizational goals. As IT changes the nature of work and the composition of the workforce, I bring in fresh perspectives to IT human capital research, such as the future of work, impact of peers on IT careers, and the nuanced discrimination issues in IT labor markets. My current and ongoing focus is on understanding opportunities for women in IT and assessing the future of IT work. Business and Societal Value of IT and IT Processes IT is a very, very fickle artifact. As countless firms have experienced, mere acquisition of IT may not lead to the riches that IT promises. No, the way to the manna is a bit more complicated, or so I would like to believe. The second strand of my research examines how firms can fructify returns from technology investments like e-commerce and RFID as well as reconciling the dichotomous goals of client satisfaction versus profitability in strategic IT outsourcing. From a managerial standpoint, my research shows that only by understanding the consequences of this adoption on all stakeholders can a firm realize the full potential of IT investments or IT processes. It also draws attention to the efficacy of formal control mechanisms in managing strategic outsourcing IT contracts from the perspective of vendors. In addition to my research agenda studying women in IT, my ongoing and future research focus is on understanding the effects of social media on firm and individual outcomes, given the ubiquity and importance of social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook to individuals and businesses. My current focus is on analyzing the value of crowd funded platforms for entrepreneurship and on societal change enabled by social media platforms.",
    "teaching": "Teaching about a dynamic subject like IT is an interesting and important part of my time here at RPI. At a more abstract level, I perceive teaching to be a collaborative effort in a knowledge exchange that benefits not only my students but also myself. In that sense, I see teaching as a platform that extends my research perspective. I have taught to undergraduates, masters, and doctoral students while here at RPI. Each one of these requires a different perspective and understanding. For both undergraduate and graduate students, my philosophy is to provoke them in thinking about how IT is an enabler of innovation and efficiency, rather than an end in itself. I use a blend of theory and cases to stimulate the learning process. I encourage class participation through in-class role-play, real-world examples, interactions with industry experts, visual aids, and stimulating discussions. I draw not only on my own professional and research experience, but also on the students\u2019 own experience to illustrate the value of IT in today\u2019s world. My teaching evaluations manifest my teaching efforts; I have won the Lally Graduate Teacher of the Year Award in 2018 and the Lally Best Teacher Award in 2020 for outstanding contribution to Lally\u2019s teaching mission.",

The installations incorporate non-Western perspectives of space, time, and action inspired by indigenous cultures, resulting in innovative ways to use interaction design to define a sense of place. As a result, my research is expanding the syntax of experience design and shaping new dimensions in relational aesthetics through the integration of physical and virtual environments. In these installations, multiple viewers use the interaction with physical and virtual elements, social discourse, and memory to define the aesthetics of the experience and a sense of place.\u201d Patricia Search has had over 40 solo exhibitions and multimedia installations of her art throughout the United States, including 11 in New York City, as well as exhibitions in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Cyprus, France, Germany and Taiwan.

    "biography": "The most recent scientific contributions by Prof. Bonitatibus are in the field of contrast media for diagnostic imaging, specifically intravenous nanoparticle-based agents for computed tomography (CT). He is credited with invention of a portfolio of intravenously administered CT contrast agents that comprise a tantalum oxide nanoparticle core coated with a biocompatible siloxane polymer shell. Prof. Bonitatibus has been funded by the NIH for developing these agents dating back to 2013. He is currently funded by the NIH, NSF, and private industry. He has authored 45 technical publications, holds 15 United States issued patents, and appeared in more than 30 presentations at national and local venues. Prof. Bonitatibus also has more than 15 years of industrial experience as a Senior Scientist at GE Global Research where he was an Independent Contributor and Project Leader, as well as a Principal Investigator for an NIH grant in conjunction with Prof. B. Yeh at UCSF on R01-EB015476 entitled \"Nanoparticle CT Contrast Agents for Reduced Radiation Dose and New Imaging Applications\" (2013-2017). He has been a co-investigator on 5 awards from the Department of Energy in the last 10 years, the most significant of which was in the area of electrocatalysis for energy storage with Prof. W. Jones at the Univ. of Rochester (DOE DE-SC0001055, 2009-2014). As a postdoctoral researcher, Prof. Bonitatibus spent two years at MIT in the labs of Prof. R. Schrock (Nobel Laureate in Chemistry, 2005) where he focused on the design, synthesis, and discovery of living organometallic olefin (cationic) polymerization catalysts. He published a total of 16 journal articles with Prof. Schrock. He earned a Ph.D. with Honors in Chemistry from Boston College under Prof. W. Armstrong where his graduate work focused on the synthesis and reactivity of low valent vanadium compounds. This research required mastery of both inert-atmosphere synthetic techniques and physical methods of characterization including single crystal chemical crystallography and electron paramagnetic resonance. Prof. Bonitatibus earned a B.S. in Chemistry from Fairfield University and under a Pfizer Fellowship Award conducted research in the area of high valent manganese-oxo cluster synthesis and oxidation chemistry with Prof. J. Sarneski in collaboration with Prof. R. Crabtree at Yale. He has a passionate interest in exploratory materials research for applications in diverse technologies enabled by liquid-phase synthesis of inorganic nanoparticles and the design, synthesis, and characterization of novel organometallics, inorganic compounds, organosilanes, and hydrosilation catalysts.

Her research intersects the field of Science and Technology Studies (particularly Infrastructure Studies) with research in Disability Studies. She focuses on the development of large technological systems, especially transport infrastructures, and the work undertaken by marginalized communities to mold these networks. Velho\u2019s current book project explores the question of accessibility in public transit. She discusses the process of stabilization of large systems in ways that have become exclusionary for specific demographics that are considered \u201cnon-standard\u201d. These barriers, she argues, have long-term consequences and often develop into a vicious cycle of social exclusion, but can be progressively overcome if marginalized communities are re-engaged in decision-making fora. Velho has also identified the active engagement of disabled people with infrastructures. She examines tactical maneuvers as ways of temporarily re-inscribing access requirements in ways that would often be considered subversive to maintainers of the network.

In close collaboration with experimental groups and through open-source software facilitating such simulations, we apply such techniques for disparate applications including hot carrier harvesting for energy conversion, long-lived spins for quantum information, interconnect materials for future semiconductor technologies and electrochemical reaction modeling for electrocatalysis. Our methods synergistically target several traditionally-disjointed fields. For example, our work to model ultrafast dynamics of electrons in nanostructures led to the discovery of highly efficient collection of almost all charge carriers excited in gold nanoparticles into gallium nitride. Variants of this approach now make it possible to design quantum materials to exploit long-lived spins. Simultaneously, this methodology has now been applied to predict new low-resistance materials for connecting nanoscale transistors in future semiconductor chips. Similarly, the capability to combine classical models of disordered materials / liquids with quantum simulations has enabled design of polymer nanocomposites, molten salts for nuclear reactors and electrocatalysts for energy conversion and chemical synthesis. Two separate Department of Energy Computational Chemical Sciences center grants now support our work on new first-principles methods for electrochemistry and for quantum dynamics.",
    "teaching": "Advanced electronic properties of materials (MTLE-6120) : Core graduate course on electronic properties of materials in MSE, offered every Spring, redesigned with a strong emphasis on quantum mechanics and solid state physics, in addition to a phenomenological survey of electronic, magnetic and optical properties of materials and interfaces. A key focus of the redesign of this course was making several electronic properties of current research interest accessible at the first-year MSE graduate level without prior exposure to quantum mechanics or solid state physics. For example, in this process we developed a pedagogical approach for explaining the high electronic mobility of graphene without invoking relativity and the Dirac equation, which was integrated into this course in Spring 2018, and subsequently published as a pedagogical journal article, Am. J. Phys. 87, 291 (2019). Material Informatics and Data Science (MTLE/CSCI-4730/6730) : New course developed from scratch to introduce MSE undergraduate and graduate students to the rapidly developing material informatics field without requiring substantial previous programming experience or computer science courses. It was first offered as a materials (MTLE) course in Fall 2018, but found interest across the school of engineering and science and has been cross-listed as a computer science (CSCI) course since its second offering in Fall 2020 to both undergraduate and graduate students. This course introduces machine learning and data science, with case studies in discovery of structure-property relationships and new materials from experimental and computational data. This course forms a key component of the Computational Materials track in MSE, and the newly-instituted Data Dexterity requirement in the School of Engineering. Materials Science for Engineers (ENGR 1600) : Introductory materials science course taken by freshmen or sophomores across the school of engineering. After recognizing the necessity for better interactive visualization tools to make complex material structures and concepts like reciprocal space in X-ray diffraction (XRD) more intuitive, we developed an Augmented Reality (AR) Android app called XrayVision to show virtual crystal models when seen through a cell phone camera, and overlay crystal planes or defects on them and show corresponding XRD patterns alongside. This was supported through an educational award / seed fund from the Teaching and Learning Collaboratory in 2018, and has been integrated into every section of ENGR-1600 since Fall 2018. Programming for Materials Engineers (MTLE 2960) : New course developed for the MSE department to replace the centralized 1-credit programming course that was cancelled. This course introduces programming with an emphasis on engineering data analysis and simulation using the Python programming language, assuming no prior exposure to programming. Modeling and Analysis of Uncertainty (ENGR 2600) : Core statistics course, with a materials science flavored section taught each summer. This section was redesigned with labs involving analysis of molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations, giving students a much deeper hands-on experience than the conventional offering.",

    "research": "Regulation of RNA synthesis is key to the control of gene expression. In bacteria, RNA is synthesized through the process of transcription by the multi-subunit enzyme RNA polymerase (RNAP). For proper initiation of transcription, RNAP must temporarily associate with a specificity subunit known as Sigma factor, to recognize a promoter, the site of transcription initiation. Bacteria can contain several Sigma factors, each differentially activated and responsible for regulating specific sets of genes or regulons. The development of Next Generation Sequencing techniques such as ChIP-seq and RNA-seq have allowed us to map the binding of multiple Sigma factors across the bacterial genome and determine, at unprecedented resolution, the regulons for each. Unexpectedly, Sigma factor binding and transcription initiation are pervasive; a large fraction of Sigma binding sites occur inside genes. This is contrary to the \u201ctextbook\u201d view where promoters are located in between genes and a short distance away from the genes that they control. The role(s) of these \u201cnon-canonical\u201d promoters is a mystery, and the next goal is unravel their function on gene expression and the cell lifecycle.",

    "biography": "Professor Gross received his Ph.D. from 'Brooklyn Poly' (Polytechnic University) working on Polymer Stereochemistry (synthetic chemistry) and then performed postdoctoral research with Robert Lenz at UMASS Amherst on the synthesis/properties of polyhydroxyalkanoates (i.e. bacterial polyesters). His research is motivated by the urgent need to develop sustainable chemicals and materials to meet the demands of a rapidly rising global population while mitigating risks of increased green-house gas emissions asociated with climate change. Gross is focusing the groups inventiveness on research that has the potential to revolutionize the way we synthesize next-generation chemicals and materials as well as improve human health. For this purpose, the group is combining the best chemical and biocatalysts to develop efficient green routes to low molar mass molecules, polymers and materials. He is also applying green chemistry principles to develop next-generation therapeutics. For this, we look to nature for tailorable bioactives and use a variety of tools to create matrices for tissue engineering and bioresorbable biomaterials. The result of our emphasis on implementing green chemical principles is the development of synthetic routes that operate under mild reaction conditions (e.g. low temperature, ambient pressure, avoid toxic reagents) that increase worker safety, improve reaction efficiencies (i.e. atom economy) while avoiding protection-deprotection steps. By working this way we increase the chance that we develop will be scalable and used. Examples of ongoing research are as follows. There is a need to develop efficient and scalable methods to synthesize peptides. These building blocks hold great promise for creating antimicrobial, metal binding, self-assembling, bioadhesives (to replace sutures) and environmentally responsive materials. However, peptide synthesis currently relies on solid and liquid phase methods (SPPS and LPPS) that are expensive and, consequently, prohibit the use of peptides in these and other exciting fields of application. Our laboratory is pioneering methods that use protease-catalyst to build peptides in aqueous media without the need for protection-deprotection steps. Protease-catalyzed peptide synthesis allows scale-up of peptide building blocks for a wide range of exciting material applications. In other work, we are using the selectivity of lipase catalysts to synthesize functional bioresorable polyesters that meet important needs for tissue engineering matrices, drug delivery systems and bioactive materials. Another focus area is the use of bacteria that directly extrude cellulose nanofibers from cell membranes that become intertwined creating interconnected nanofiberous 3-D matrices. One aim in this program is to control matrix parameters including fiber size and porosity to tailor bacterial cellulose for applications as membranes for separation/water purification, reservoirs for liquid crystals that form voltage regulated switchable windows and much more. Also, our laboratory is looking to nature for next-generation bioactive compounds (e.g. anticancer, antimicrobial, immunomodulators, insecticides and tick repellents). This work makes use of a family of surface active microbial synthesized glycolipids that can be molecularly engineered to enhance their physical and biological properties. In addition, we are using essential oils and their components as potent/renewable/safe pesticides, insecticides and tick repellents. Some of these antimicrobial components are finding their way into a new family of adherent films that protect fruits and vegetables from premature spoilage. Emulsion and encapsulation technologies are being used to effectively apply or deliver these natural bioactives. Another group project is motivated by the problem of plastic pollution. It is now evident that seperating plastic wastes and physical recycling of recovered plastics has largely failed to create effective pathways for plastic re-use. While our group is interested in the overall potential of biorecycling, work thus far has focused on a family of enzymes known as cutinases that actually degrade plastic water bottles made from PET to their constituent building blocks (terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol). Our ability to engage in this large array of project areas is possible due to our belief that thet best work is done through productive collaborations with scientists and engineers that bring new perspectives and expertise. Consequently, we have developed productive long-term collaborations with physicists, biologists, biomedical engineers, entomologists, mechanical engineers and process engineers. Gross has about 500 publications in peer-reviewed journals that have been cited over 26,000 times (h-index 82, i10-index 362). He has graduated over 40 Ph.D. students who are enjoying successful carreers in industry and acedmics.

    "biography": "Dr. Fan's research interest lies in the analysis of nonstationary and long-memory time series data that can be applied in many areas in finance, including financial markets prediction, financial systemic risk, portfolio investment, and risk management. Specifically, her research has been focused on developing statistical methods that can be used to deal with nonstationary issues when conducting statistical inference or making predictions. Her work in this context is directed towards: 1. Identification of informative economic and financial predictors of market returns. A new inference approach, MBB-IVXQR, is proposed in one of her recent papers to test for the significance of both nonstationary and stationary predictors. Different from the widely used filtration methods such as first-differencing, the IVX-filtration can maintain the maximum amount of information in a nonstationary data stream during the process of filtration. In the simulated experiments, it has been shown that the proposed method can effectively reduce more than 50% of the inference errors of the conventional methods. 2. Prediction of rare events in the financial markets. Her research also focuses on time series quantile regression and its application in finance. Quantile regression (QR) is a powerful statistical method that can be used to identify heterogeneous relationships between economic variables. In finance, it can be applied to identify useful information to predict the bad/good time in the market. With an understanding of the properties of the financial time series data, she has proposed several statistical methods to apply the quantile regression method to analyze the rare events in the financial markets. 3. Applying machine learning techniques to the analysis of high-dimensional, nonstationary time series data. Some of her recent work focuses on dealing with high-dimensional time series data when some time series are stationary, some are nonstationary, and some are cointegrated. Dr. Fan proposes to use the adaptive lasso method for selecting mixed-root predictors in an increasing-dimension framework, and prove its validity and efficiency. She also provides sufficient evidence from the analysis of financial markets to show that this method can greatly reduce the forecasting errors relative to conventional statistical methods.",

Nierzwicki-Bauer, together with colleagues, pioneered the development and application of molecular approaches for tracking, detecting and quantifying invertebrate larvae including zebra and quagga mussels. For over twenty years she has carried out applied studies that deal with management of aquatic invasives once they have been introduced into freshwater bodies, as well as proactive monitoring/detection strategies to help prevent colonization. Recently, Nierzwicki-Bauer together with an international team of collaborators are developing genetic tools for free-living and symbiotic cyanobacteria. The Nierzwicki-Bauer lab focuses on three distinct areas of research: (1) Molecular studies of microbial and picoeukaryote communities in lakes and rivers. The biodiversity of freshwater microbial and picoeukaryotes is still understudied (compared with marine environments) with many more organisms to be discovered. We are using molecular approaches, as well as more traditional culturing and microscopic methodologies to elucidate the structure and function of community composition in Adirondack lakes, some of which have been impacted by acid rain or other pollutants. (2) Basic and applied studies of invasive species (zebra mussels). Zebra mussels are an invasive species that have significant economic and ecological impacts. We are carrying out basic studies on zebra mussels which include; development of molecular probes for their early detection and bioassays for gaining a better understanding of chemical and physical factors that influence or can predict their survival. We are carrying out applied studies that deal with management of zebra mussels once they have been introduced into freshwater bodies, as well as proactive monitoring/detection strategies to help prevent colonization. (3) Water resource management and environmental remote sensing. We are using a combination of traditional and advanced techniques to study human impacts on water resources. The approaches that we are utilizing include automated water chemistry profiling systems, side-scan sonar, satellite remote sensing, solar powered autonomous underwater vehicles (SAUV\u2019s) and hydroacoutics, to name a few.",

Disruptions in the integrity of these networks have been linked to disease, and chemical compounds that target biopolymers such as microtubules have been used extensively as therapeutics in the treatment of disease. Single molecule biophysical studies of proteins and DNA have yielded insights into the function of individual components required for these processes. However, intracellular networks are organized on the micron-scale by the collective action of ensembles of dozens of such proteins. It is currently unclear how long-range mechanical cues are transmitted or how diverse nanometer-scale \u2018building blocks\u2019 are organized within the micron-scale structures that do work in cells. The Forth lab combines biophysical techniques, such as optical trapping and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, to understand how forces are transmitted across these networks. By reconstituting functionally active microtubule networks out of purified components and monitoring how the system behaves under biologically relevant mechanical constraints, we seek to elucidate the mechanisms that drive successful cell division, neuronal development, and cell migration.",

    "biography": "Dr. Seemanti Ramanath completed her Ph.D. degree at RPI. Towards her Ph.D degree, she used cloning techniques to create multiple transgenic fly lines to study the Muscle Physiology of Drosophila melanogaster (fruitflies), focussing on understanding the structure-function of myosin isoforms. Her undergraduate degree is in Microbiology from the Sophia College for Women, Mumbai, India. Her master's degree is from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where she worked in the area of Plant Molecular Systematics. This research work required the collection and analysis of data from DNA sequences, as well as the study of morphological traits of native North American and Meso-American plant species, within Apiaceae subfamily Apioideae. This endemic plant group includes several well-known herbs and edibles, such as Daucus carota (carrots). Post-doctoral training at RPI, immediately after her Ph.D., allowed her to extend her Ph.D. thesis work. For further post doctoral training, she moved cross the River Hudson, to SUNY Albany, where she investigated the biochemical effects on intein splicing in an ancient iron-sulfur protein, SufB in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. She started teaching BIOL 1015 Labs \"Introduction to Biology Labs\" in the Fall of 2014, at RPI. At RPI, she teaches BIOL 1010 \"Introduction to Biology\" during the Summer II term of each academic year. She teaches BIOL 2960 \"Human Evolution Lab\" during the Summer I term, and BIOL 1961 \"Sense and Signal\" during the Summer III term. Till date, Dr. Ramanath has taught greater than 6,000 students at RPI. Dr. Ramanath strongly believes in creating a welcoming environment in her labs (37 majors enrolled in BIOL 1015 labs in Fall 2022), and being inclusive of diverse intellectual, creative and cultural pursuits and perspectives. Having lived in 7 countries, she speaks Assamese, Hindi, and English is her third language. Upstate New York is home, and the U.S.A. is her home country. But, Dr. Ramanath was born in Assam, India, at the foothills of the Himalayas. As a child, she spent 2 years in Adelaide, Australia. As an adult, she spent a couple of months in Linkoping, Sweden, a summer in Tsukuba, Japan, and almost a year in Stuttgart, Germany. Most recently, she spent 1 month in Hong Kong, China. Learning Swahili in college with her Kenyan friends from Nairobi, Hiragana (Japanese) during a summer in Japan, introductory German via a 6 month long crash course, and Sanskrit during a year in middle school gave her a taste of our rich human linguistic diversity. These life experiences have taught Dr. Ramanath, that on the whole, there is much unity in our shared human socio-cultural diversity, irregardless of our individual socio-economic status, or our separate geographic origins. Hence, in her labs, participation in group lab-work is emphasized because it provides an opportunity for all voices to be heard. Students get together in labs, and work on a common project. What emerges is novel, and unpredictable from a mere knowledge of the parts, and greater than the sum of the individual participants. This lab dynamic, not only enables students to insightfully see several aspects of a problem, through the different perspectives of peers, but allows them a chance to engage in peer-to-peer dialogue, and to make connections across disciplines and majors. Once such connections are built, the impact of such collaborations typically endure. This scholastic network supports students, as they weave their way through college, and beyond, into the workplace. It is connections, collaborations and community, that are crucial towards the success of every student's professional and personal life. If you have not yet taken a course with Dr. Ramanath, what are you waiting for? If you have already taken one of her courses, be sure to write her an email including your glad tidings since you graduated from RPI!",

    "teaching": "Dr. Seemanti Ramanath has taught greater than 6,000 students at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. She (Dr. R to her students) continuously evaluates course content, seeking to supply basic skills to RPI undergraduates via her course design. Her major goal is to infuse in them the spirit of lifelong learning about our world. Knowledge of our world, means to discover the causal factors for natural phenomena by the proper application of the Scientific Method, and through the thorough analysis of data. Hence, her courses are designed with this goal in mind. She believes that this process of discovery is what will ultimately lead RPI students to \"change the world\". Academics & Research Background: Dr.R. completed her undergraduate degree in Microbiology at Sophia College for Women, in Mumbai, India. At the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, she obtained her Master's degree in Plant Molecular Systematics. This research work required the collection and analysis of data from DNA sequences, as well as the study of morphological traits of North American and Meso-American plant species within Apiaceae subfamily Apioideae.

Her post-doctoral training involved investigating the biochemical effects on intein splicing in an ancient iron-sulfur protein, SufB in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Thus, Dr. R. brings a broad academic training and perspective to her innovative course design at RPI. Managerial Background: Along the way, Dr. R. earned partial M.B.A. degree credits, which education she finds valuable in her current position, managing large enrollments each semester, composed of a wide spectrum of majors, coordinating multiple laboratory sections, and supervising diverse groups of personnel, inclusive of the training of graduate teaching assistants (TAs), undergraduate mentors (UGMs), federal work study (FWS) students, and mentoring new Faculty Lecturers in BIOL 1015 Lab courseware. Teaching Goals: Whether studying bacteria, plants, or animals, Dr.R. states that it is the visualization of the underlying molecular mechanisms in the data patterns that enables the building of new knowledge. In her courses, students tackle multiple and diverse data types, thereby gaining a strong introduction to basic laboratory skills. Students apply foundational concepts from diverse fields within biology, for instance, microbiology/molecular biology, bioinformatics/phylogenetics, biochemistry/structural biology, and bio-computations/bio-statistics. Students gain data dexterity, which is essential to the building of the basic tool-kit of a well-equipped RPI graduate.",

    "biography": "Sergei Nirenburg has worked in the areas of cognitive science, artificial intelligence and natural language processing (NLP) for over 40 years, leading R&D teams of up to 80. His professional interests include developing computational models of human cognitive capabilities and implementing them in hybrid-engine models of societies of human and computer agents; continued development of the theory of ontological semantics; and acquisition and management of knowledge about the world and about language. R&D teams under his leadership have implemented a variety of application systems for cognitive modeling, intelligent tutoring and a variety of NLP tasks (machine translation, question answering, text summarization, information extraction, computational field linguistics, knowledge elicitation and learning). Dr. Nirenburg has written two and edited five books and published over 190 scholarly articles in journals and peer-reviewed conference proceedings. He is Member of the International Committee on Computational Linguistics and Honorary Editor of Machine Translation, the archival scholarly journal, which he served as Editor-in-Chief in 1987-96. He has been Program Committee Chair for Machine Translation Summit III (Washington, DC, 1991), the Conference on Applied NLP sponsored by the Association for Computational Linguistics (Seattle, WA, 2000) and COLING 2004 in Geneva, Switzerland. He served as a director of two NATO-sponsored Advanced Studies Institutes on Language Engineering for Lesser-Studied Languages (Ankara, Turkey, 2000 and Batumi, Georgia, 2007). Between 1985-2007 he founded and served as Permanent Steering Committee Chair of a series of 11 international conferences on Theoretical and Methodological Issues in Machine Translation of Natural Languages (TMIs). Current projects center on development of the OntoAgent cognitive architecture environment for modeling artificial intelligent agents and application systems based on it. OntoAgent-based systems integrate such diverse capabilities as simulation of human physiology, decision making, language understanding and text synthesis, belief maintenance and ascription, \u201cmindreading\u201d and learning \u2013 all of the above relying on a variety of extensive and deep-coverage knowledge resources, such as a detailed ontological world model, a deep-semantic lexicon, etc. Applications of OntoAgent are in the domains of clinical medicine (a tutoring environment for medical personnel with OntoAgents playing the roles of a virtual patient and a tutor and CLAD, a clinician\u2019s advisor environment); cognitive robotics, forensics-oriented applications, integrated interpretation of perception inputs (e.g., vision and language) as well as learning based on stored knowledge and language understanding and generation. Dr. Nirenburg is also working in the field of computational descriptive linguistics. In this area, he is developing human-computer interactive systems for guided acquisition of knowledge about so-called \u201clesser-studied (natural) languages\u201d and systems for text simplification that will, for example, allow non-experts to understand the gist of texts written by specialists for specialists.",

    "research": "My research follows two streams. The first focuses on developing new Bayesian methods through the emerging generation of generative neural networks. The second focuses on building and applying computational models of complex processes (e.g., cognition, disease outbreaks) to gain insights from data ( and sometimes Big Data ). These two streams converge at the BayesFlow framework for Bayesian inference with modern deep learning ( GitHub )( project page ), of which I am the core developer and maintainer. In the new computer age, modern Bayesian inference allows us to estimate, validate, and draw substantive conclusions from high-fidelity probabilistic models. Typical problems in Bayesian analysis are: Estimate the posterior distribution of hidden parameters from noisy data (i.e., inverse inference); Compare competing models in terms of their complexity and predictive performance; Emulate the observable behavior of a system or predict future behavior under uncertainty. However, despite their theoretical appeal and utility, Bayesian workflows are limited by severe computational bottlenecks: Analyzing even a single data set may already eat up days of computation, so that model validation and calibration become completely infeasible. BayesFlow addresses these challenges by training custom generative neural networks on model simulations. Researchers can then re-use and share these networks for any subsequent application of the model. Since the trained networks can perform inference almost instantaneously (typically well below one second), the upfront neural network training amortizes quickly. For instance, amortized inference allows us to test a model\u2019s ability to recover its parameters or assess its uncertainty calibration for different data set sizes in a matter of seconds, even though this may require the estimation of thousands of posterior distributions. If you are a student who wants to do research at the frontier of probabilistic modeling, drop me a mail or simply pass by my office.",

    "biography": "Professor Steven Cramer is the William Weightman Walker Professor of Polymer Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, New York. His lab is currently conducting research on several areas related to protein-surface interactions and molecular bioprocessing. Many of the past contributions from Professor Cramer and his students to the field of Chromatographic Bioprocessing have had dramatic impacts on the state of the art of this technology and its successful implementation for the biomanufacturing of biological products. Their development of adsorption isotherm models of various classes of protein chromatography (in particular his steric mass action (SMA) model for ion exchange) have enabled the prediction of non-linear protein chromatographic behavior in a range of adsorption systems. These models have been widely employed in academic research and have been utilized worldwide by the biotechnology industry. Their invention of low molecular weight displacers for protein purification represented a paradigm shift in displacement chromatography and included several new modes of mass action and chemically selective displacement chromatography. Their development of a Quantitative Combinatorial Design (QCD) approach has resulted in the discovery of a range of novel displacers and affinity ligands. The Cramer lab was one of the first to employ high throughput screening (HTS) for developing chromatographic bioprocesses which has had a dramatic impact on the way bioprocess development in now carried out in the industry. Their work on the purification of antibodies using both protein A and mimetic resin systems produced a series of papers that had a major impact on the field of antibody purification. Prof. Cramer and his students also pioneered a new methodology for the a-priori prediction of protein binding in chromatographic systems from crystal structure which is now being incorporated by many biopharmaceutical companies for process development. The Cramer lab\u2019s multidisciplinary work using a combination of biophysics, molecular dynamics simulations and chromatography with protein libraries has provided significant insights into the design of novel multimodal chromatographic systems. Recent work on integrated biomanufacturing and expedited process development is having a dramatic impact on how bioprocess development is carried out in the industry. The Cramer lab is now actively involved in several gene therapy downstream biomanufacturing projects, continuous mRNA processing, and several big data modeling efforts. In addition to his focus on downstream bioprocessing, Professor Cramer is known worldwide for his expertise in separations in general. He served as the Editor-in-Chief of the International journal Separations, Science and Technology for 20 years. Professor Cramer has won numerous awards including the ACS National Award in Separations Science and Technology, the ACS BIOT Division\u2019s Michaels Award in the Recovery of Biological Products, and several awards from RPI including the Wiley Distinguished Faculty Award and the School of Engineering Outstanding Professor and Research Excellence Awards. In addition, he has been elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering and a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, American Institute of Chemical Engineers, the American Chemical Society, and the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering. Cramer holds 11 patents and has published extensively in the top peer-reviewed journals in the field with 228 publications and an h index of 54 and 9007 citations. Importantly, the 55 Ph.D. graduates from the Cramer lab have had a significant impact with many of his former students now playing key leadership roles in the state of the art of industrial bioprocessing at most of the major biopharmaceutical and bioseparations companies worldwide as well as academia.",

    "research": "Our lab is interested in the kinesin molecular motors and their interactions with microtubules. While kinesins share common structural motifs, key amino acid residue changes confer unique mechanochemical properties to each kinesin, which determine their specific cellular functions. Our current goal is to define how a specific kinesin is engineered to orchestrate its transport properties. We use a range of experimental approaches including in vitro motility assays, single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, and stopped-flow kinetics. Recently, we discovered that the widely used general anesthetic propofol shortened the distance a single kinesin can step along a microtubule by 40-60%. In collaboration with my colleague Marvin Bentley, we discovered that propofol can impact organelle transport in live hippocampal neurons, shortening the distance that different types of organelles can travel by 40-60%. Moreover, the results show that the propofol-induced transport delay causes a significant decrease in vesicle fusion in distal axons, which may alter physiological function during and after anesthesia. Defining the intricacies of kinesin-driven transport is critical to developing therapeutic strategies for broad range of diseases including neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and ciliopathies. We believe that diversity and inclusion are essential to achieving excellence. We strive to create a lab culture where each individual is supported and where we all are inspired to achieve our personal aspirations. We teach and help each other, we mentor and collaborate, and we share our expertise with others with the common goal to advance scientific discovery and foster new research areas.",

He has experience in teaching core engineering courses like Introduction to Engineering Design and Engineering Economics. His research expertise is in the computational modeling of concrete class materials in fresh and hardened states. His doctoral research demonstrated the dependency of critical failure modes of reinforced ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) beams on the mechanics of interplay between continuous and discrete reinforcements. Furthermore, he evaluated the adequacy of a novel multi-scaling technique for the numerical simulation of UHPC. He also numerically predicted flow-induced fiber anisotropy for a novel flow-based casting process and numerically validated its impact on the mechanical properties and failure behavior of UHPC in the solid hardened state. He is also interested in applying smart systems for structural health monitoring and vibration control. Previously, he numerically investigated the seismic performance of different structural bracing arrangements and control algorithms with smart magnetorheological fluid dampers during his tenure at IIT-K.",

    "research": "Research opportunities for students: NanoTEC lab offers opportunities for a variety of hands-on, experimental, manufacturing, and simulation & design projects for Master, PhD, and undergraduate students. More than 20 PhD students, 46 Master, and 140 undergraduate students have participated in research advised by Dr. T. Borca-Tasciuc. Email about research interest to: borcat@rpi.edu. Background: Non-Fourier heat conduction has critical implications for the thermal management of nanodevices, nanointerconnects, optoelectronics, or the design of nanocomposites and nanomaterials. On another hand, nanostructures and nanostructured materials enable novel ways to independently control the thermoelectric properties (Seebeck coefficient and electrical and thermal conductivities) that define the thermoelectric figure of merit Z, a metric important for thermoelectric energy conversion applications (such as solid state refrigeration and power generation). Description: NanoTEC lab develops experimental techniques able to probe thermal and thermoelectric properties at nanoscale, in nanomaterials, across-nanointerfaces, or to test the operation of nanoscale electronic, optoelectronic, and thermoelectric devices. These techniques are employed to perform studies of property-structure relationship to understand and optimize thermal and thermoelectric transport as required by specific applications. Selected examples of techniques developed include: 1) a scanning thermal probe techniques for accurate temperature and thermal conductivity measurements; 2) a transient method for measurement of all thermoelectric properties as well as electrical and thermal contact resistances in films; 3) a photothermoelectric method to determine the anisotropic thermal conductivity and the interface thermal resistance in thin film on-substrate systems; 4) a Joule heating thermometry method for characterization of thermal transport from nanoscale heat sources. In many projects novel nanomaterials studied in the NanoTEC lab are obtained or synthesized through national and international collaborations with world experts in nanomaterials synthesis and material structure characterization. Selected research outcomes include: discovery of a new class of highly scalable, high figure of merit, nanostructured bulk thermoelectric materials (patent) implementation of a novel mechanism for formation of high thermal conductivity networks in polymer composites filled with nanoparticles (patent) characterization of anisotropic thermal properties in aligned carbon nanotube arrays and aligned carbon-nanotube polymer composites characterization of the interface thermal resistance at the native interface between carbon nanotube arrays and the silicon substrate characterization of effective thermal conductivity of Si/Ge and Si/SiC multilayers development of high accuracy Scanning Thermal Microscopy techniques for temperature and thermal conductivity measurements discovering the importance of doping, topological effects, and pressure on enhancing the thermoelectric figure of merit Applications of NanoTEC research: CHIPS (memory and logic) Thermal Management Sustainable Buildings Thermal Systems Scanning Thermal Microscopy Surgery and Medical Devices Temperature and Thermal Properties Metrology Thermoelectric Device Design and Characterization Thermal Interface Materials Thermoelectric Materials Thermal Energy Conversion Systems Selected research articles Sensitivity and Spatial Resolution for Thermal Conductivity Measurements using Non-contact Scanning Thermal Microscopy with Thermoresistive Probes under Ambient Conditions (link): https://academic.oup.com/ooms/advance-article/doi/10.1093/oxfmat/itab011...

    "biography": "Prof. Tomek Strzalkowski research interests span a wide spectrum of human language technology including computational linguistics and sociolinguistics, socio-behavioral computing, interactive information retrieval, question-answering, human-computer dialogue, serious games, social media analytics, formal semantics, and reversible grammars. He has directed research sponsored by IARPA, DARPA, ARL, AFRL, NSF, the European Commission, NSERC, as well as a number of industry-funded projects. He was involved in IBM\u2019s Jeopardy! Challenge in advanced question answering. Dr. Strzalkowski has published over a hundred and fifty scientific papers, and is the editor of several books, including Advances in Open Domain Question Answering. He serves on the Editorial Board of the journal of Natural Language Engineering. Prior to joining RPI, Dr. Strzalkowski was Professor of Computer Science at SUNY Albany. At SUNY, he was the founding Director of the Institute for Informatics, Logics, and Security Studies with research budget of more than $35 million. He came to SUNY from GE CRD where he was a Natural Language Group Leader and Principal Scientist. At GE, Dr. Strzalkowski directed projects on automated technical manuals, medical informatics, speech recognition, automated summarization, as well as multimedia processing including language and video. Before coming to GE, he was a research faculty at the Courant Institute of New York University, where he worked on applications of natural language processing to information retrieval. Current projects include research into social dimensions of information spread online, internet ethnography, and building effective AI defenses against disinformation and exploitation of human socio-cognitive vulnerabilities online, including social engineering attacks. Some example projects include: GATOR: The Goal-oriented Autonomous Dialogue System. We develop a new type of human-machine dialogue system that uses deep learning technologies (such as transformers) to learn how to recognize and generate dialogue plans, i.e., semantic and pragmatic structures that represent one party\u2019s goals and intentions, as well as the impact these are having on the other party. Unlike the current transformer-driven chatbots, the core learning is not to transform one language expression (input) into another language expression (response) but instead to construct a response plan that would properly address the plan in the input and the history of interaction. Consequently, the learning process takes three types of information: (1) the input utterance; (2) its semantic-pragmatic plan, i.e., the plan that was used to produce the utterance, and (3) the history of interaction up to this point. Furthermore, the cumulative history of the dialogue is not merely the memory of the utterances exchanged earlier, but it captures, in a condensed semantic form, the evolving state of the parties\u2019 objectives as well as the emerging sociolinguistic behavioral patterns of both (all) parties. Personalized AutoNomous Agents Countering Social Engineering Attacks (PANACEA) protects online users against current and future forms of social engineering. PANACEA serves as an intermediary between attackers (human, automated, hybrid, coordinated) and the potential victim(s) they target. Depending upon the nature and source of communication, PANACEA either handles it autonomously, or allows the user to proceed with an exchange while monitoring the conversation and intervening as needed by (1) inserting or modifying users\u2019 messages, (2) instructing the user how best to respond, while at the same time (3) initiating an investigation to identify the attacker. (DARPA ASED Program) COMETH (Computational Ethnography from Metaphors and Polarized Language). The objective of this project is to develop a methodology and accompanying software tools for constructing dynamic socio-behavioral models of communities based on online content that their members produce. A community can be defined by the set of salient concepts that its members recognize, along with the values they assign to them. The resulting causal models are then applied to derive culturally biased interpretations of novel information by prototyping the process by which such new information is adapted to fit into the community current model. (DARPA UGB) Social Convos: A New Approach to Modeling Information Diffusion in Social Media. In this project, we recast our understanding of all social media as a landscape of collectives, or \u201cconvos\u201d: sets of users connected by a common interest in an (possibly evolving) information artifact, such as a repository in GitHub, a subreddit in Reddit or a group of hashtags in Twitter. Convos are represented by the collections of features that capture their internal social dynamics. Furthermore, convos are basis for modeling large and small internet-based communities as \u201chybrid organisms\u201d that interact in various ways with one another and react collectively to external stimuli, including information and disinformation campaigns.

    "biography": "W. Randolph Franklin develops and implements fast parallel algorithms on very large geometric datasets in CAD and GIS. He's also modeled and processed large terrain databases, e.g., to compress, to compute hydrography and visibility, and to site observers, and compressed 5D environmental data sets. The algorithms are the fastest in their class. His current research hobby is designing and implementing small, simple, and fast data structures and algorithms for large geometric datasets. Note that efficiency in both space and time can become more important as machines get faster. This research is applicable to computational cartography, computer graphics, computational geometry, and geographic information science. He is now currently studying parallel CAD operations, such as overlaying 3D triangulations (tetrahedrulations). 3D-EPUG-Overlay is an algorithm for exactly computing the intersection (it can also compute general overlays) of pairs of 3D triangulated meshes. Each input mesh may represent a single solid or a more complex polygonal subdivision (representing multiple solids, each one identified by a label). 3D-EPUG-Overlay employs a combination of several techniques to ensure its correctness and efficiency. His last major NSF research project was to understand the mathematics of terrain. Another recent NSF project, together with Cutler and Zimmie, was analyzing how levees erode when overtopped, and testing models in a geotechnical centrifuge. Subprojects include compressing terrain while preserving slope, compressing multidimensional environmental data, and extending partial hydrological data to a complete and consistent river network. Another major project compressed and operated on terrain for DARPA/DSO/GeoStar. The operations included multiple observer siting and path planning. His longterm uneachable goal is to establish terrain modeling on a proper formal foundation that respects its physical properties.

    "biography": "As an industrial researcher, Wesley Turner has had a varied career with varying focus depending on the needs of the research communities and industries to which he has belonged. This is reflected in the varying types of research in which he has been engaged. Some examples of researc initiatives are included below. Computational Linear Algebra: Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is a powerful method for modeling the behavior of dynamic systems and processes. Most finite element formulations require the solution of linear systems of equations either as a direct result of a discretization process, or as part of the iterative solution to a nonlinear discretization. These linear systems are generally sparse and often symmetric positive definite (SPD). While efficient solution processes are well understood for many formulations, particularly where the condition number of the system matrix is well behaved, systems which are exceedingly large, or that deviate from SPD can exhibit rapid growth in the condition number making the system solution much more difficult. In this research, Wesley Turner investigated the efficient solution of large, sparse, non-symmetric systems with the goal of effectively limiting the growth of the condition number via a preconditioning operation. The preconditioner was derived based on a hierarchical (spatial) decomposition of the physical space of the FEA analysis. Both the preconditioner and the underlying solution methods were designed for parallel implementation on a large distributed memory computer. Forensic Facial Reconstruction: Reconstruction of the facial features of an individual based on the skull in isolation is an important part of archaeological and criminal investigation. The historic manner of reconstruction relies on sparse flesh depth measurements. Clay is placed on a model of the skull to match a prescribed flesh depth at a few measurement points and is then \u201cartistically\u201d smoothed to interpolate the face between the sparse depth markers. In this research Wesley Turner was part of a team who used medical imaging to precisely characterize the facial flesh depth densely across populations of individuals. This data was used to generate a statistical model for variation that could be adapted to a given skull in isolation resulting in both an average, i.e. likely, face for a given skull as well as the modes of variation that could be anticipated. His primary contributions to this research were in the deformable registration of the skulls to a single representative exemplar and in the generation and visualization of the reconstruction to include visualization of the modes of variation. Cancer Detection and Characterization: Despite decades of research by the medical and scientific communities, cancer remains a serious health issue. Early detection is critical to patient prognosis. Fortunately, advances in medical imaging are giving us increasing opportunities to find lesions while they are small enough to be treated effectively. These advances, however, are not without a cost. Detecting small lesions requires increased imaging resolution resulting in larger image sizes and more images for review. In this research, Dr. Turner was involved in reducing radiologist workload and improving detection and lesion characterization via automated analysis of the medical images. This work has spanned multiple imaging modalities (CT, MRI, OCT, etc.) and multiple lesion types (lung, brain, breast, etc.), but all of the research can be broadly classified as detection and characterization. In that context, his role has been to develop and apply mathematical models and imaging heuristics to medical images in order to differentiate lesions form normal anatomy and to measure lesion features. Manufacturing Processes and Inspection: As in the medical world, automatic or computer-aided detection of anomalies in manufactured parts can result in increased safety and lower costs. Simulating operations on manufactured parts and performing inspections is critical. While this is a broad area, Wesley Turner's major contributions to this research were (1) the generation of a virtual environment mocking up a part inspection cell so that inspection could be performed efficiently; (2) providing registration mechanisms to align the inspected part to a CAD model, to align detected anomalies to their precise location on a manufactured part, and to precisely align scan cell components to the virtual environment; and (3) generating reproducible and robust plans for automatic scan procedures. Big Data Initiatives in Healthcare: Increasingly, data is becoming commonplace, but access to data and getting the analysis capability into the hands of domain researchers such as biologists, doctors or other healthcare workers, geneticists, and etc. is becoming the true bottleneck. In this research, Dr. Turner explored the twin topics of ease of use and semantic interchange. His primary outputs were a system (Visomics) that coupled data aggregation and algorithm development with a mechanism for efficient use by domain experts using tools familiar to them; and a system architecture document describing a patient-centric protocol for secure and semantically valid exchange */",
