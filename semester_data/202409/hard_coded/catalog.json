        "description": "This course is an introduction to logic-based artificial intelligence (AI). We learn techniques for designing and engineering AIs with human-level (or higher) cognitive intelligence, enabled by automated reasoning as the cornerstone for: planning, learning, decision-making, communicating, creativity, and perceiving. A special emphasis is placed upon giving AIs intellectual powers that are beyond the reach of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and other so-called “foundation models,” which, based as they are on statistical/numerical machine learning (e.g. deep learning, which is driven by data stripped of logical meaning and structure), are congenitally (and dangerously) prone to poor performance in applications that require high precision and accuracy, and/or require formally verified correct behavior. We thus direct our attention to solving the very problem currently occupying the first-rate minds of many at companies in the AI sector of the economy, e.g. Google. Thus those who succeed in this course will be in position to offer such companies skills that are increasingly sought, but are in very short supply. We explore how to remedy the deficiencies of LLMs with AI based on computational logics, from the propositional calculus, through fragments of first-order logic crucial for the World Wide Web’s productive operation, on up to logics needed to model and simulate very high levels of human and machine intelligence. Our programming paradigm is logic programming, introduced and taught from scratch, starting slowly from so-called “Horn Logic.”"
