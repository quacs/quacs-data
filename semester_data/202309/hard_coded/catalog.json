        "description": "Creative applications of generative artificial intelligence have exploded in the past year, including image generation tools like Stable Diffusion and DALLE-2 and text generation tools like Chat-GPT3.  This course will survey the theoretical foundations of these tools, focusing on generative models and self-supervised learning, as well as explore the historical and ethical considerations involving the procedural generation of art.  Students will apply cutting-edge tools for generating creative content and critique each otherâ€™s work."
