In the 20th century, the movements of Cubism, Futurism, Neo-Plasticism, Constructivism, Purism, Surrealism, and Dadaism consisted of dynamic dialogs between architecture and painting. These exchanges allowed each to have a profound and deep impact upon the other. By contrast, in early 21st century, there seems to be all but a mute relationship between the two. This course intends to help break that silence. This course will begin to bridge the divide by establishing new connections between the current preoccupations with materials, procedures, and affects that are emerging in both contemporary painting and architecture. Twisted Siblings seeks to explore and discover new relationships between the most cutting-edge digital technologies and how painting may influence the expressive capacities of these technologies. As contemporary painting and architecture seek to establish future directions, a new dialog and exchange of ideas should be emerging, to ensure a dynamic and radical future for both. The course will consist of a series of lectures, discussions, and presentations. Students will be expected to research a number of individual architects, painters, and writers who are producing work of related interest. Students will be responsible for completing a research project, which synthesizes the content of the course.",

First, students will learn the basics of digital signal processing, develop an understanding of measurement equipment and analysis methods for sound. The course will examine the ISO standards of room-acoustic measurements, develop students\u2019 research goals and a specific set of data to gather for their research. The course will also prepare the students with the fundamental knowledge on CATT Acoustic and/or EASE in geometrical modeling. Then the students and professors will visit a number of performance venues (e.g. EMPAC Concert Hall, and/ or other venues) and perform the room-acoustic measurements. Students will then work on analyzing and interpreting the research results. Practice measurements will be scheduled in the gallery or somewhere on campus before trips to performance halls. MATLAB will play a central role throughout all the classes (SRL I & II) and the thesis research projects. It will be used during the class exercises. Within one week from the semester start, every student is required to INSTALL a functioning MATLAB Software package onto her/his laptop computer.",

The course will also give students a deeper theoretical understanding of architectural acoustics in order to assist them in room acoustics research. There will also be labs to reflect typical measurement procedures and (if time permits) site visits to acoustics research labs and different types of acoustical spaces. The Sonics Research Lab II emphasizes more training on independent hands-on and problem-solving skills (than the SRL I).",

We learn techniques for designing and engineering AIs with human-level (or higher) cognitive intelligence, enabled by automated reasoning as the cornerstone for: planning, learning, decision-making, communicating, creativity, and perceiving. A special emphasis is placed upon giving AIs intellectual powers that are beyond the reach of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and other so-called \u201cfoundation models,\u201d which, based as they are on statistical/numerical machine learning (e.g. deep learning, which is driven by data stripped of logical meaning and structure), are congenitally (and dangerously) prone to poor performance in applications that require high precision and accuracy, and/or require formally verified correct behavior. We thus direct our attention to solving the very problem currently occupying the first-rate minds of many at companies in the AI sector of the economy, e.g. Google. Thus those who succeed in this course will be in position to offer such companies skills that are increasingly sought, but are in very short supply. We explore how to remedy the deficiencies of LLMs with AI based on computational logics, from the propositional calculus, through fragments of first-order logic crucial for the World Wide Web\u2019s productive operation, on up to logics needed to model and simulate very high levels of human and machine intelligence.

In this course, students will learn and explore using machine learning techniques to automate the design process of digital games. The course will cover basic and advanced topics in Artificial Intelligence and Learning, such as Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Genetic Algorithms, and Reinforcement Learning. Students will gain hands-on experience in applying these techniques in computer games. The course will also introduce psychological theories and studies about people\u2019s decision-making and emotional processes and how they are related to the players\u2019 experience in games.

We learn techniques for designing and engineering AIs with human-level (or higher) cognitive intelligence, enabled by automated reasoning as the cornerstone for: planning, learning, decision-making, communicating, creativity, and perceiving. A special emphasis is placed upon giving AIs intellectual powers that are beyond the reach of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and other so-called \u201cfoundation models,\u201d which, based as they are on statistical/numerical machine learning (e.g. deep learning, which is driven by data stripped of logical meaning and structure), are congenitally (and dangerously) prone to poor performance in applications that require high precision and accuracy, and/or require formally verified correct behavior. We thus direct our attention to solving the very problem currently occupying the first-rate minds of many at companies in the AI sector of the economy, e.g. Google. Thus those who succeed in this course will be in position to offer such companies skills that are increasingly sought, but are in very short supply. We explore how to remedy the deficiencies of LLMs with AI based on computational logics, from the propositional calculus, through fragments of first-order logic crucial for the World Wide Web\u2019s productive operation, on up to logics needed to model and simulate very high levels of human and machine intelligence. Our programming paradigm is logic programming, introduced and taught from scratch, starting slowly from so-called \u201cHorn Logic.\u201d",

    "description": "This course is an introduction to logic-based artificial intelligence (AI). We learn techniques for designing and engineering AIs with human-level (or higher) cognitive intelligence, enabled by automated reasoning as the cornerstone for: planning, learning, decision-making, communicating, creativity, and perceiving. A special emphasis is placed upon giving AIs intellectual powers that are beyond the reach of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and other so-called \u201cfoundation models,\u201d which, based as they are on statistical/numerical machine learning (e.g. deep learning, which is driven by data stripped of logical meaning and structure), are congenitally (and dangerously) prone to poor performance in applications that require high precision and accuracy, and/or require formally verified correct behavior. We thus direct our attention to solving the very problem currently occupying the first-rate minds of many at companies in the AI sector of the economy, e.g. Google. Thus those who succeed in this course will be in position to offer such companies skills that are increasingly sought, but are in very short supply. We explore how to remedy the deficiencies of LLMs with AI based on computational logics, from the propositional calculus, through fragments of first-order logic crucial for the World Wide Web\u2019s productive operation, on up to logics needed to model and simulate very high levels of human and machine intelligence. Our programming paradigm is logic programming, introduced and taught from scratch, starting slowly from so-called \u201cHorn Logic.\u201d",
