The fundamentals of statics are presented in order to gain an understanding of the way in which external forces produce internal stresses in individual members and, in essence, flow through the building system to be resolved at the foundation level. The principles of strength of materials are studied to understand how particular structural materials and configurations manage to resist these forces without unacceptable distortions, or even failure. Wood structural properties are studied in all their complexity as a means to internalize the more theoretical topics broached. Through in-class presentations, reading, homework and project work, computer lab, field trips, and case studies, the student will be aided in developing this intuitive (while practical) understanding. It is recognized that intuitions of building technologies are not acquired quickly but result from much study, observation, and practice.

The fundamentals of statics are presented in order to gain an understanding of the way in which external forces produce internal stresses in individual members and, in essence, flow through the building system to be resolved at the foundation level. The principles of strength of materials are studied to understand how particular structural materials and configurations manage to resist these forces without unacceptable distortions, or even failure. Wood structural properties are studied in all their complexity as a means to internalize the more theoretical topics broached. Through in-class presentations, reading, homework and project work, computer lab, field trips, and case studies, the student will be aided in developing this intuitive (while practical) understanding. It is recognized that intuitions of building technologies are not acquired quickly but result from much study, observation, and practice. Introduction to Structures makes use of the several approaches above to ensure that the beginning student is provided with a broad, solid base for future structural investigations.

It will consider the role of government in making resource allocation choices. Students will also study important macroeconomic data such as gross domestic product, economic growth rates, inflation, and unemployment.

Similarly, the concept of a 'policy,' high-level guidelines providing a general course of action (or inaction) in a given area, is not new. Putting those two concepts together, however, is a recent phenomenon which has created a set of intriguing challenges. What is 'open data?' What does it mean to 'share' data? Who makes such policies and how are they implemented? Do data policies look the same all over the world? What are the economic, cultural, and technological implications/impacts of/on a given data policy? How would one even go about understanding and evaluating a data policy? This course takes the basics of policy design and analysis, blends in critical thinking skills, ethics, group dynamics, national perspectives, and international perspectives, and applies it all to the world of big data.",

    "description": "In order to survive, corporations need to renew themselves. This requires instilling an entrepreneurial mindset which is often a challenge for large established corporations. Corporations caught up in the web of commoditization, stagnation, down-sizing, cost-cutting, re-engineering and the fast pace of globalization and technical change have come to realize that boosting their entrepreneurial capabilities, can improve their competitive positions through creating new markets and even transforming their industries. Yet overall, these efforts have produced uneven success. Although entrepreneurs in organizations can benefit from the knowledge resources, experience, and financial assets and networks of the large firm, they are constrained by the firm's inertial structure and entrenched management practices, as well as by the influence of current customers. This course helps students understand these challenges and how to cope with them through developing appropriate corporate competencies, structures, systems, and talent management practices.",

The course offers instruction in linguistic, rhetorical, and sociocultural concepts through its overarching focus on language: how it works, where it falls short, and how to harness it for specific purposes. Critical thinking and composing are conceptualized as processes, which includes the creation, development, organization, and revision of ideas and arguments. Students will complete a series of writing assignments in order to participate in contemporary debates occurring in both public and academic contexts.",
