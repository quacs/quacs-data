    "description": "Research in Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is driven by data. Researchers in these fields collect, manipulate, model and analyze data generated by real-world processes. \u00a0Since the amount of data available has grown exponentially, the ability to automate these tasks through computer programs is essential. Specifically, probabilistic and statistical computing are needed to learn from the data. The objectives of this course are for the student to perform exploratory data analysis and to acquire the basics of statistical and machine learning in order to model real-world datasets."

    "description": "Digital gaming is one of the most rapidly developing fields. The effort required for developing games is not trivial. To make a game fun to play, the design of the game levels and/or the AI-driven opponents need to be intelligent and adaptive to the players' strategies and skills. In this course, students will learn and explore using machine learning techniques to automate the design process of digital games. The course will cover basic and advanced topics in Artificial Intelligence and Learning, such as Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Genetic Algorithms, and Reinforcement Learning. Students will gain hands-on experience in applying these techniques in computer games. The course will also introduce psychological theories and studies about people's decision-making and emotional processes and how they are related to the players' experience in games. This course will take the form of a combination of lectures, presentations by students, class discussions, and independent study."
