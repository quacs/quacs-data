Many new projects are introduced each semester, though many ongoing and \"higher-profile\" projects are also undertaken. Overall, students are required to work on and contribute to open source projects, in particular through multiple commits (commit early, commit often), maintaining a blog, presenting their work and/or specific technical talks, mentoring other projects, etc. This project-based \"course\" may be taken multiple semesters, with grades based on clear effort and contributions rather than a project that meets all of its requirements.",

Modern Binary Exploitation will focus on teaching practical offensive security skills in binary exploitation and reverse engineering. Through a combination of interactive lectures, hands on labs, and guest speakers from industry, the course will offer students a rare opportunity to explore involved subjects in a rapidly evolving field. The course will start off by covering basic x86 reverse engineering, vulnerability analysis, and classical forms of Linux-based userland binary exploitation. It will then transition into defenses found on modern systems (Canaries, DEP, ASLR, RELRO, Fortify Source, etc) and the techniques used to defeat them. Time permitting, the course will also cover other subjects in exploitation including kernel-land and Windows based exploitation, as well as static analysis of binaries.",

In particular, in her new book, Robotics Through Science Fiction, award-winning roboticist Robin Murphy explores issues in modern AI research through the lens of six famous science fiction stories.  This book presents six classic science fiction stories and commentary that illustrate and explain key algorithms or principles of artificial intelligence. The book is designed to let students grapple with two questions that stir debate even today: how are intelligent robots programmed? and what are the limits of autonomous robots? The stories-by Isaac Asimov, Vernor Vinge, Brian Aldiss, and Philip K. Dick-cover telepresence, behavior-based robotics, deliberation, testing, human-robot interaction, the \"uncanny valley,\" natural language understanding, machine learning, and the ethics of AI and robots.",
