RCOS is a project-based course in which students join a project team and work primarily on one open-source project throughout the semester. Projects must be open source but can be existing external projects, internal (RCOS) projects, or new endeavors. Collaborative and cross-disciplinary projects are encouraged. Students are required to consistently contribute to their open source projects, in particular through multiple commits (commit early, commit often), presenting their work and/or specific technical talks, mentoring other projects, and generally contributing to the open source community.",

The course will use the Athena dual computation/deduction language, and the MIT Press book \"Fundamental Proof Methods in Computer Science\" by Konstantine Arkoudas and David Musser. Students will also review current research on software verification on topics of their interest, for example: model checking, program analyses, symbolic testing, temporal logic, modal logics, formal programming language semantics, proof-carrying code, dependent types, and session types. Contingent on time availability, the course will study proofs at an abstract level for reusability and their application to proofs about concurrent actor programs.",
